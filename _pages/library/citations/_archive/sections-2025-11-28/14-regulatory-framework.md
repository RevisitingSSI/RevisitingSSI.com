  > **BRIEF**: Four-layer model legislation demonstrating technology-neutral regulatory approach with anti-coercion provisions and platform independence requirements.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen proposes model legislation for state digital policy structured in four layers: Layer 0 (Cryptographic Secret Protection—preventing forced key disclosure), Layer 1 (Digital Signature and Assent), Layer 2 (Cryptographically Verifiable Records as self-authenticating evidence), and Layer 3 (Digital Identity Recognition via verifiable credentials). The framework translates technical distinctions into legal categories, includes anti-coercion provisions and portability requirements, and can be adopted incrementally at no cost.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: Four-layer model legislation demonstrating technology-neutral regulatory approach. Includes anti-coercion provisions (economic duress protection, essential service obligations, behavioral surplus extraction prohibitions), platform independence requirements, and standards framework. Foundation for regulatory frameworks supporting SSI without creating centralization.

### Allen (2025) Swiss e-ID Anchors

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates how government digital identity systems can preserve autonomy—addresses "voluntary in law" eroding to "mandatory in practice" pattern.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Christopher Allen examines Switzerland's e-ID adoption and proposes five anchors protecting personal autonomy and democratic sovereignty: (1) Preserve Choice by Design—voluntary participation with granular data sharing control; (2) Build Long-Term Architecture—20-year sustainability with data minimization; (3) Maintain Platform Independence—prevent Apple/Google surveillance through jurisdictional oversight; (4) Require Duties for Commercial Parties—strict purpose limitation and deletion requirements; (5) Implement Institutional Safeguards—independent governance protecting against government overreach and corporate misuse. Demonstrates how government identity systems can preserve autonomy: "agency over our digital identity remains with us."

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: Demonstrates how government digital identity systems can preserve autonomy. Addresses documented pattern where "voluntary in law" erodes to "mandatory in practice" (Estonia 99% adoption, India Aadhaar, Ireland Public Services Card).

### Utah Code Title 46 (2021)

[statute]. _Utah State Legislature._ Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://law.justia.com/codes/utah/2021/title-46/>. Official: <https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title46/Title46.html>.

  > **BRIEF**: State legislation recognizing digital identity credentials without creating government monopoly—model for "recognition without mandate."

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Utah Code Title 46 establishes the legal framework for electronic signatures and digital identity verification. Chapter 1 enables remote notarization with identity verification through public/proprietary data sources. Chapter 3 (Digital Signature Act) covers certification authority licensure. Chapter 4 (UETA) provides that electronic records and signatures satisfy legal requirements for writing and signature, with attribution rules for electronic acts.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: State legislation recognizing digital identity credentials without creating government monopoly—model for "recognition without mandate." Key provisions: legal recognition of credentials from any issuer; agency law foundation; no exclusive government control; technology-neutral standards. Utah avoided state identity monopoly and avoided mandating specific technical standards.

### EU Regulation 2024/1183 eIDAS 2.0

  > **BRIEF**: EU digital identity framework demonstrating both benefits (legal recognition, interoperability) and risks (government-centric architecture, limited platform independence).

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 fundamentally amends the original eIDAS Regulation (910/2014) to establish EU-wide European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) framework. Published April 30, 2024; entered into force May 20, 2024. Member states must provide voluntary digital wallets by end of 2026 enabling citizens to prove identity, share documents, and verify attributes across the EU while maintaining full control of shared data. Public services required to accept wallets for authentication. Implementing acts specify technical standards for certification. Represents both benefits (legal recognition, interoperability) and risks (government-centric architecture, standardization constraints).

Study as regulatory framework with resources but tensions with SSI's decentralization principles.
