### Foundational Principles & Rights

#### [The Irreducible Person](/lenses/briefs/irreducible-person/)

You exist—no system needs to grant that, and none should take it away. This lens examines the operational paradox: some aspects of personhood (dignity, existence, cognitive liberty) lose their protective meaning the moment we try to measure them. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/3)

  - [_**The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2016). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._](#allen-2016-path-to-self-sovereign-identity)

    > **BRIEF**: Foundational 2016 article establishing 10 principles of self-sovereign identity and tracing identity system evolution from centralized to user-centric to self-sovereign models.

  - [_**Compliance SSI System Property Set**_ (2022). [journal article]. _Pattiyanon, Charnon; Aoki, Toshiaki._](#cssps-2022)

    > **BRIEF**: Framework of 42 verifiable properties bridging SSI principles and legal/regulatory compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

  - [_**Race After Technology**_ (2019). [book]. _Benjamin, Ruha._](#benjamin-2019-race-after-technology)

    > **BRIEF**: Exposes how technologies reproduce racial inequity while appearing neutral, introducing "New Jim Code" concept for discriminatory automation.

  - [_**Universal Declaration of Human Rights**_ (1948). [treaty]. _United Nations._](#udhr-1948)

    > **BRIEF**: Foundational 1948 declaration establishing universal human dignity and rights as basis for international human rights law.

#### [Anti-Property](/lenses/briefs/anti-property/)

When we talk about "owning our data," we risk turning ourselves into products. This lens examines why property law fails for identity—you can't sell yourself like you sell a car—and proposes agency-based alternatives where delegation creates duties, not markets. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/4)

  - [_**Beyond Data**_ (2023). [book]. _Renieris, Elizabeth M._](#renieris-2023-beyond-data)

    > **BRIEF**: Foundational market-inalienability theory—some things too bound up with personhood to commodify.

  - [_**Whiteness as Property**_ (1993). [paper]. _Harris, Cheryl I._](#harris-1993-whiteness-as-property)

    > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates how property law historically encoded racial hierarchies—whiteness functioned as property granting access and protection.

  - [_**Between Truth and Power**_ (2019). [book]. _Cohen, Julie E._](#cohen-2019-between-truth-and-power)

    > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates how code and law co-construct identity as extractable capital; property frameworks actively create data as commodity.

  - [_**The Illusion of Personal Data as No One's Property**_ (2015). [paper]. _Purtova, Nadezhda._](#purtova-2015-illusion-of-personal-data)

    > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates "no one owns data" is illusion—corporations already claim quasi-property rights.

  - [_**Privacy in Context**_ (2009). [book]. _Nissenbaum, Helen._](#nissenbaum-2009-privacy-in-context)

    > **BRIEF**: Foundational privacy theory—violations occur when information flows breach context-specific norms.

#### [Right to Transact](/lenses/briefs/right-to-transact/)

If you can be prevented from participating, none of the other principles matter. This lens grounds SSI in constitutional rights—free assembly, free association, peer-to-peer exchange—and warns that de-platforming from dominant wallets means losing not just a service, but your operational identity. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/5)

    > **BRIEF**: Critiques framing financial freedom as fundamental right, warning of libertarian capture.

#### [Cryptographic Paradigms](/lenses/briefs/cryptographic-paradigms/)

PKI assumptions have constrained digital identity for 36 years. This lens asks what paradigm assumptions we're embedding now that will limit what SSI can become—and how to write principles that enable future capabilities we haven't yet invented. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/6)

### Preventing Coercion

#### [Coercion Resistance](/lenses/briefs/coercion-resistance/)

Privacy is the shield, but coercion resistance is the goal. This meta-lens coordinates four dimensions of manipulation: dark patterns that exploit cognitive limits, profiling that infers what you never disclosed, structural lock-in that traps you, and internalized surveillance that makes you police yourself. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/7)

    > **BRIEF**: Develops surveillance capitalism framework—unprecedented economic logic extracting behavioral surplus.

#### [Self-Coercion](/lenses/briefs/self-coercion/)

The most effective control is the kind that feels like your own idea. This lens examines invisible coercion—chilling effects, anticipatory compliance, behavioral conformity—harms that persist even with perfect cryptographic privacy because you stop yourself before any rule is enforced. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/8)

  - [_**Chilling Effects**_ (2016). [paper]. _Penney, Jonathon W._](#penney-2016-chilling-effects)

    > **BRIEF**: Documents how search algorithms perpetuate racism and create conformity pressure through biased categorizations.

#### [Choice Architecture & Exit Rights](/lenses/briefs/choice-architecture/)

Small voluntary decisions accumulate into structural dependency. This lens examines the 18-year trap: credentials stored in proprietary formats, reputation that doesn't transfer, biometrics that can't be revoked—and why reversible design and proportionate exit rights are coercion resistance, not convenience features. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/9)

  - [_**The Tyranny of Convenience**_ (2018). [article]. _Wu, Tim._](#wu-2018-tyranny-of-convenience)

  - [_**Principal Authority**_ (2021). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._](#allen-2021-principal-authority)

    > **BRIEF**: Provides agency law framework where delegation with accountability enables genuine exit rights.

#### [Binding Commitments](/lenses/briefs/binding-commitments/)

Not all lock-in is harmful—Kenyan chamas prove that voluntary constraint enables trust. This lens distinguishes productive commitment (mutual stakes, transparent terms, bounded scope) from exploitative lock-in (asymmetric power, opaque terms, punitive exit), because SSI needs commitment mechanisms, not just escape hatches. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/10)

  - [_**The Identity Cycle**_ (2021). [book]. _Grigg, Ian._](#grigg-2021-the-identity-cycle)

  - [_**The Strategy of Conflict**_ (1960). [book]. _Schelling, Thomas C._](#schelling-1960-strategy-of-conflict)

    > **BRIEF**: Game theory classic showing how credible commitment enables cooperation impossible for uncommitted actors.

  - [_**Commitment Devices**_ (2010). [paper]. _Bryan, Gharad et al._](#bryan-et-al-2010-commitment-devices)

    > **BRIEF**: Comprehensive review of commitment device research showing how voluntary constraints enable better outcomes.

### Relational & Contextual Identity

#### [Relational Autonomy](/lenses/briefs/relational-autonomy/)

Ubuntu teaches "I am because we are"—yet SSI architectures model identity as individual attribute containers. This lens examines what's lost: immigration systems that can't see family bonds, chama membership invisible to credit systems, and how relationship-aware credentials could change both. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/11)

#### [Multi-Scalar Sovereignty](/lenses/briefs/multi-scalar-sovereignty/)

Sovereignty doesn't stop at the individual—200,000 Kenyan chamas manage $1.7 billion without institutional permission. This lens examines how autonomy operates across persons, communities, and nations, warning against "sovereignty-as-a-service" models that centralize power while claiming to distribute it. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/13)

  - [_**Sovereignty-as-a-Service**_ (2025). [paper]. _Grohmann, Rafael; Costa Barbosa, Alexandre._](#grohmann-2025-sovereignty-as-a-service)

### Compliance, Governance & Technical Foundations

#### [From Principles to Compliance](/lenses/briefs/principles-to-compliance/)

Not everything important can be measured—but that doesn't mean it can't be verified. This lens develops a three-tier framework: what can be technically tested, what requires regulatory enforcement, and what must remain ethical commitment—because treating all principles as measurable destroys the ones that matter most. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/15)

  - [_**Compliance SSI System Property Set**_ (2022). [journal article]. _Pattiyanon, Charnon; Aoki, Toshiaki._](#cssps-2022)

    > **BRIEF**: Technology-neutral legal framework showing how existing law applies to cryptographic systems.

#### [Regulatory Frameworks](/lenses/briefs/regulatory-framework/)

Legal "voluntary" erodes to practical "mandatory" within years—Estonia, Aadhaar, Ireland prove the pattern. This lens proposes technology-neutral legal structures that enable SSI without mandating it: anti-coercion provisions, platform independence requirements, and recognition without state monopoly. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/16)

  - [_**Digital Law Framework**_ (2025). [paper]. _Allen, Christopher._](#allen-2025-digital-law-framework)

    > **BRIEF**: EU digital identity framework demonstrating both benefits and risks of government-centric architecture.

#### [Principal Authority](/lenses/briefs/principal-authority/)

Current platforms violate every duty agents owe principals: they exceed scope, act in their own interest, manipulate through dark patterns, hide what they do, and make exit prohibitively costly. This lens shows how agency law—centuries of established doctrine—can restore accountable delegation to digital identity. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/17)

  - [_**Principal Authority**_ (2021). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._](#allen-2021-principal-authority)
