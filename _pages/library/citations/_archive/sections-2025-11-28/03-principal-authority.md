  > **BRIEF**: Analyzes Wyoming SF0039's legal grounding of digital identity in Agency law, reorganizing SSI principles as Principal rights and Agent duties.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen analyzes Wyoming's SF0039—first U.S. legal definition of digital identity using "principal authority" to import Agency law precedent. Reframes 10 SSI principles as rights (existence, control, persistence, consent), identity duties (access, transparency, portability, interoperability, minimization, protection), and Agency duties (specificity, responsibility, representation, fidelity, disclosure). Grounds SSI in peer-to-peer relationships mediated by state rather than property law's state sovereignty.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: Wyoming SF0039 provides first U.S. legal definition grounding digital identity in Agency law—importing centuries of common law precedent rather than requiring novel legislation. When individuals delegate to identity agents, agents owe enforceable duties with established remedies. Reorganizes SSI principles into Principal rights and Agent duties with legal teeth.

### Restatement Third of Agency (2006)

  > **BRIEF**: Authoritative U.S. codification of Agency law establishing enforceable duties agents owe principals with centuries of precedent.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: The Restatement (Third) of Agency defines agency as "the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (principal) manifests assent to another (agent) that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control." Volume 1 covers attribution, authority creation/termination, and ratification. Volume 2 addresses third-party contracts, tort liability, and mutual duties. Key fiduciary duties include loyalty (§8.01-8.06), preventing agents from using principal's property or position for personal benefit.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: Authoritative U.S. codification of Agency law with centuries of precedent. Establishes enforceable duties agents owe principals—loyalty (act in principal's interest), care (reasonable skill), obedience (within authorized scope), accounting (disclose all material information). SSI systems structured as agency relationships inherit this entire legal apparatus.

  > **TAGS**: #InformationFiduciaries #FirstAmendment #DigitalPrivacy #FiduciaryDuty #PlatformGovernance #BalkinJack #LegalTheory #DataProtection #ConstitutionalLaw

  > **BRIEF**: Introduces "information fiduciary" concept—platforms holding user data owe fiduciary duties of care, confidentiality, and loyalty.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Balkin introduces the "information fiduciary" concept to explain how digital privacy can be protected consistent with the First Amendment. Like doctors and lawyers, online service providers who encourage trust should assume special duties regarding information obtained from users. Governments may impose privacy regulations enforcing these fiduciary obligations without violating free speech protections. The framework also explains why the third-party doctrine should be modified in Fourth Amendment law.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: Extends fiduciary law to digital relationships—platforms holding user data in positions of trust owe duties of care, confidentiality, and loyalty. Proposes graduated duties matching delegation depth, supporting this lens's framework of fiduciaries (highest duties), agents (moderate duties), and bailees (minimal duties).

  > **BRIEF**: Examines how automated systems create "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans through case studies of welfare, homeless services, and child welfare.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Eubanks examines how automated systems in social services create a "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans. Through case studies of Indiana's automated welfare eligibility, Los Angeles' homeless services triage, and Allegheny County's child welfare risk scoring, she shows high-tech tools intensify historical patterns of discrimination through speed, scale, and an appearance of objectivity.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: "Voluntary" biometric enrollment for food assistance illustrates Type C coerced participation violating every Agency duty—no specificity (data used beyond stated purpose), no responsibility (high error rates), no representation (serves state cost-cutting not recipient welfare), no fidelity (manipulative framing), no disclosure (opaque algorithms), no revocability (biometrics permanent). Demonstrates what happens when agency framework is violated entirely.
