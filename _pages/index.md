Welcome to the **Revisiting Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Principles** series of online workshops.

This initiative marks the ten-year anniversary of the original SSI principles in 2016. In the decade since their publication, SSI has evolved from a provocative idea into infrastructure deployed by governments, companies, communities, and open protocols. At the same time, the sociotechnical environment around identity has been transformed by new technologies and new platform models that challenge the assumptions of 2016.

The moment is right for us to ask:

* **What has worked?**
* **What has drifted?**
* **What harms or risks have emerged?**
* **And what must evolve for SSI's next decade?**

This project is a **multi-phase, year-long effort** to reassess, update, and strengthen the [Ten Principles of SSI](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/#ten-principles-of-self-sovereign-identity).

## Phase 1 Goals

Our goals in Phase 1 are to:

- **Map the problem space** through interdisciplinary perspectives
- **Explore new lenses** that reveal blind spots or opportunities
- **Develop brief scoping papers** (Lens Exploration Briefs) that seed deeper research and technical work
- **Surface emerging harms, risks, and tensions** in digital identity systems
- **Build shared understanding** across diverse backgrounds
- **Move toward rough consensus** on worthy insights about the principles
- **Inform** both an updated set of SSI principles *and* other high-level strategies for reducing societal harms from digital identity systems

We are **not** writing standards, specifications, protocols, or product designs at this stage. We are instead engaging in *high-level conceptual, ethical, and strategic inquiry*, the groundwork on which principled SSI work must rest.
