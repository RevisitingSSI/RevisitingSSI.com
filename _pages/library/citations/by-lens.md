### Foundational Principles & Rights

#### [The Irreducible Person](/lenses/briefs/irreducible-person/)

You exist—no system needs to grant that, and none should take it away. This lens examines the operational paradox: some aspects of personhood (dignity, existence, cognitive liberty) lose their protective meaning the moment we try to measure them.

#### [Anti-Property](/lenses/briefs/anti-property/)

When we talk about "owning our data," we risk turning ourselves into products. This lens examines why property law fails for identity—you can't sell yourself like you sell a car—and proposes agency-based alternatives where delegation creates duties, not markets. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/4)

#### [Right to Transact](/lenses/briefs/right-to-transact/)

If you can be prevented from participating, none of the other principles matter. This lens grounds SSI in constitutional rights—free assembly, free association, peer-to-peer exchange—and warns that de-platforming from dominant wallets means losing not just a service, but your operational identity. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/5)

    > **BRIEF**: Applies enshittification framework to labor markets—workers cannot "delete the app" when employment is prerequisite for all life essentials.

#### [Cryptographic Paradigms](/lenses/briefs/cryptographic-paradigms/)

PKI assumptions have constrained digital identity for 36 years. This lens asks what paradigm assumptions we're embedding now that will limit what SSI can become—and how to write principles that enable future capabilities we haven't yet invented. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/6)

### Preventing Coercion

#### [Coercion Resistance](/lenses/briefs/coercion-resistance/)

Privacy is the shield, but coercion resistance is the goal. This meta-lens coordinates four dimensions of manipulation: dark patterns that exploit cognitive limits, profiling that infers what you never disclosed, structural lock-in that traps you, and internalized surveillance that makes you police yourself. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/7)

    > **BRIEF**: Documents frontier of identity coercion—cognitive liberty as "precondition to any other concept of liberty."

#### [Self-Coercion](/lenses/briefs/self-coercion/)

The most effective control is the kind that feels like your own idea. This lens examines invisible coercion—chilling effects, anticipatory compliance, behavioral conformity—harms that persist even with perfect cryptographic privacy because you stop yourself before any rule is enforced. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/8)

  - [_**Chilling Effects**_ (2016). _Penney, Jonathon W._](/library/citations/all/#penney-2016-chilling-effects)

    > **BRIEF**: "Without accountability, no trust. Without trust, no consent."—connects platform design to self-policing.

#### [Choice Architecture & Exit Rights](/lenses/briefs/choice-architecture/)

Small voluntary decisions accumulate into structural dependency. This lens examines the 18-year trap: credentials stored in proprietary formats, reputation that doesn't transfer, biometrics that can't be revoked—and why reversible design and proportionate exit rights are coercion resistance, not convenience features. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/9)

  - [_**The Tyranny of Convenience**_ (2018). _Wu, Tim._](/library/citations/all/#wu-2018-tyranny-of-convenience)

    > **BRIEF**: Algorithms enable network-based discrimination evading categorical antidiscrimination law—SSI must address network position.

#### [Binding Commitments](/lenses/briefs/binding-commitments/)

Not all lock-in is harmful—Kenyan chamas prove that voluntary constraint enables trust. This lens distinguishes productive commitment (mutual stakes, transparent terms, bounded scope) from exploitative lock-in (asymmetric power, opaque terms, punitive exit), because SSI needs commitment mechanisms, not just escape hatches. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/10)

### Relational & Contextual Identity

#### [Relational Autonomy](/lenses/briefs/relational-autonomy/)

Ubuntu teaches "I am because we are"—yet SSI architectures model identity as individual attribute containers. This lens examines what's lost: immigration systems that can't see family bonds, chama membership invisible to credit systems, and how relationship-aware credentials could change both. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/11)

    > **BRIEF**: Open cliques support fluid social modeling where not everyone is connected.

#### [Context Boundaries & Anti-Correlation](/lenses/briefs/context-boundaries/)

Your employer shouldn't see your therapy notes; your landlord shouldn't know your political donations. This lens examines context collapse—when separate spheres of life merge through correlation attacks—and proposes unlinkable identifiers that keep your different worlds cryptographically distinct. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/12)

  - [_**The Age of Surveillance Capitalism**_ (2019). _Zuboff, Shoshana._](/library/citations/all/#zuboff-2019-surveillance-capitalism)

    > **BRIEF**: Behavioral surplus extraction deliberately collapses context boundaries.

#### [Multi-Scalar Sovereignty](/lenses/briefs/multi-scalar-sovereignty/)

Sovereignty doesn't stop at the individual—200,000 Kenyan chamas manage $1.7 billion without institutional permission. This lens examines how autonomy operates across persons, communities, and nations, warning against "sovereignty-as-a-service" models that centralize power while claiming to distribute it. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/13)

#### [Stewardship](/lenses/briefs/stewardship/)

When caring for someone else's digital identity—are you empowering or exploiting? This lens examines care relationships (parents, guardians, platforms) where the person being helped had no voice in choosing you, cannot exit, and bears permanent consequences of your decisions. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/14)

### Compliance, Governance & Technical Foundations

#### [From Principles to Compliance](/lenses/briefs/principles-to-compliance/)

Not everything important can be measured—but that doesn't mean it can't be verified. This lens develops a three-tier framework: what can be technically tested, what requires regulatory enforcement, and what must remain ethical commitment—because treating all principles as measurable destroys the ones that matter most. [Discuss on GitHub](https://github.com/RevisitingSSI/Community/discussions/15)

#### [Regulatory Frameworks](/lenses/briefs/regulatory-framework/)

Legal "voluntary" erodes to practical "mandatory" within years—Estonia, Aadhaar, Ireland prove the pattern. This lens proposes technology-neutral legal structures that enable SSI without mandating it: anti-coercion provisions, platform independence requirements, and recognition without state monopoly.

#### [Principal Authority](/lenses/briefs/principal-authority/)

Current platforms violate every duty agents owe principals: they exceed scope, act in their own interest, manipulate through dark patterns, hide what they do, and make exit prohibitively costly.
