## Coercion Resistance as a Foundational Orientation for SSI

#### **1. Territory / Focus Summary**

**Core Insight**: Privacy is not the ultimate goal of Self-Sovereign Identity—it is the shield. The deeper purpose is **protecting people from coercion**. Privacy protections prevent visibility; coercion resistance ensures autonomy even when visible. You might share credentials openly yet remain free from manipulation, dependency, or manufactured consent. Digital identity can empower—but it can also control. Coercion arises when systems leave us no real choice: when you must share data to get a job, accept terms you don’t understand, or enroll biometrics to receive food or medicine.

**Example**: When you open a new wallet, "Quick Setup" auto-enables biometric authentication, cloud backup to the provider's servers, and analytics sharing—all framed as "recommended for your security." "Custom Setup" is buried three screens deep, each option described in jargon implying you're making your account less secure. You "consent" but under manufactured urgency and manipulative defaults. The interface coerces through framing, defaults, and deceptive design. You clicked "I agree"—but to what, and under what conditions? **This is coercion operating through interface design, not explicit force.**

SSI emerged to resist centralized identity control, but decentralized architecture alone doesn't guarantee freedom from coercion. Distributed systems can manipulate through interfaces, lock users in through proprietary formats, profile behavior through inference, and consolidate power through governance capture.

Across surveillance, governance, and behavioral economics research, a common pattern emerges:

> **Visibility → Legibility → Control → Coercion.**

Identity systems that make people visible enable classification (legibility), which enables governance (control), which becomes coercive once alternatives disappear or become too costly. This chain operates whether systems are centralized or decentralized—so SSI must treat coercion resistance as a primary design concern, not an afterthought.

Self-Sovereign Identity, seen through this lens, aims at freedom through autonomy, dignity through agency, and resilience through decentralization—a world where people can act, choose, think, and define themselves without fear, manipulation, or hidden constraints.

#### **2. Relationship to Other Lenses**

This lens functions as a **meta-lens**—an umbrella framework explaining why other coercion-focused lenses matter and how they work together. Coercion operates across four dimensions, each addressed by specialized lenses:

- **Interface coercion** (this lens): Dark patterns, manipulative defaults, deceptive design that exploit cognitive biases to override user autonomy.

- **[Self-Coercion](../self-coercion/)**: Psychological dimension—how surveillance knowledge creates self-censorship before any rule is violated. People avoid legitimate credential claims fearing discrimination; anticipatory compliance operates invisibly.

- **[Choice Architecture](../choice-architecture/)**: Structural lock-in and exit costs—how credential dependency chains, platform lock-in, and exit penalties transform initially voluntary choices into permanent dependencies where leaving becomes prohibitively costly.

- **[Context Boundaries](../context-boundaries/)**: Inference coercion through correlation—how inference from relationship patterns across contexts enables behavioral profiling that creates pressure to conform to predicted patterns.

Together these specialized lenses address coercion comprehensively. This meta-lens explains why we need multiple coercion-focused perspectives rather than viewing technical decentralization alone as sufficient for freedom.

#### **3. Why This Lens Matters for SSI**

**Coercion operates across four dimensions that technical decentralization cannot prevent**:

**Interface coercion (technical)**: Wallet onboarding uses dark patterns—urgency prompts, manipulative defaults, bundled consent. "Quick Setup" enables biometric auth, cloud backup, analytics. "Custom Setup" buried, each option implying security risk. Users "consent" under manufactured pressure. The interface coerces through cognitive exploitation, not explicit force.

**Inference coercion (cognitive)**: Credential verification systems track which credentials you present, when, to whom. Machine learning infers political orientation, health status, sexuality from presentation patterns. No explicit profiling, but job offers, housing access, insurance rates quietly adjust based on inferred categories. You begin conforming to predictions—avoiding credentials that might trigger negative inferences. **Coercion operates invisibly before any explicit discrimination.**

**Structural coercion (systemic)**: Credential dependency chains eliminate alternatives—can't get job without credential, can't get credential without biometric, can't get biometric without national ID. Each step appears "voluntary" but the chain is coercive. Platform lock-in through proprietary wallet formats makes exit prohibitively costly. Users accumulate credentials over years, discover switching means losing everything. **(See [Choice Architecture](../choice-architecture/) lens for comprehensive treatment.)**

**Psychological coercion (internalized)**: Surveillance knowledge creates self-censorship before any rule is violated. People avoid legitimate credential claims fearing discrimination. Privacy-protective choices become marked as suspicious. Anticipatory compliance—modifying behavior based on imagined future consequences—operates invisibly. **(See [Self-Coercion](../self-coercion/) lens for comprehensive treatment.)**

**Property law as coercion infrastructure** (legal/foundational): [Anti-Property](../anti-property/) lens demonstrates how property frameworks **legitimize** interface coercion through legal mechanisms. "Click to agree" becomes property transaction—consent-as-sale framing where users "voluntarily" transfer identity through adhesion contracts. Property law provides legal infrastructure making manipulation appear consensual: Facebook doesn't steal data, users "license" it; platforms don't trespass, users "grant access." Property + dark patterns = systematic extraction with legal cover, not illegal theft.

**Ethical grounding** (dignity-based): [Irreducible Person](../irreducible-person/) provides **ethical foundation** for why coercion violates human dignity. Coercion (all forms—interface, structural, psychological, property-based) constitutes dignity violation because it treats persons as manipulable objects rather than autonomous agents whose existence and worth precede all systems. When platforms coerce through dark patterns or property law enables extraction, they violate the fundamental principle: existence and dignity are not earned, proven, or conditional—they simply are. Coercion resistance ultimately defends irreducible personhood.

**Why this Lens matters**: Coercion-awareness as living practice: SSI is not a fixed technical stack; it is a living ecology that must continuously anticipate and neutralize evolving coercive patterns. Coercion resistance is an ongoing practice, not a one-time design claim. These aren't separate problems—they're facets of a unified threat to autonomy. Interface manipulation enables inference. Inference creates structural dependencies. Dependencies produce psychological internalization. Property law legitimizes all of it through "voluntary" transactions. **All forms of coercion violate human dignity**. Current SSI focuses on cryptographic privacy for individual attributes but doesn't systematically address coercion operating through design patterns, behavioral profiling, structural lock-in, internalized compliance, property-based legal legitimization, and dignity violations.

#### **4. Key Harms, Risks, or Questions**

- **Interface manipulation through dark patterns**: Urgency prompts exploit time pressure, manipulative defaults favor platform benefit over user privacy, bundled consent obscures real choices, deceptive design makes privacy-preserving options difficult to discover. "Quick Setup" vs. "Custom Setup" framing makes complexity manipulation—users believe they're choosing safety when accepting surveillance.

- **Inference-based profiling creating conformity pressure**: AI systems predict mood, behavior, political orientation from credential patterns without consent. Behavioral and emotional profiling creates pressure to conform to predicted patterns. Psychographic segmentation enables targeted manipulation. Inference about sensitive attributes (health, sexuality, beliefs) from non-sensitive data. Creates "inference closure" where predictions become self-fulfilling through differential treatment.

- **Structural dependencies eliminating alternatives**: Credential dependency chains lock people into specific identity providers. Service exclusion for those refusing biometric or invasive verification. Bureaucratic complexity makes alternatives practically inaccessible. Network effects punish non-participation or exit. Platform lock-in through proprietary formats makes switching prohibitively costly.

- **Governance consolidation preventing contestation**: Centralized trust registries become de facto gatekeepers. Wallet providers with unilateral terms-of-service changes. Authority consolidation preventing meaningful contestation or accountability. Even decentralized systems can re-centralize around dominant nodes or institutional actors.

- **Cognitive coercion through mental surveillance**: Erosion of mental privacy (surveillance of thoughts, attention, emotional states), threats to mental integrity (manipulation of beliefs, preferences, decision-making), disruption of psychological continuity (undermining coherent sense of self over time), constraint of cognitive self-determination (limiting how we think, attend, or form judgments).

#### **5. Constructive Directions**

These aren't comprehensive solutions—they're provocations for exploration:

- **Non-Coercive Interface Design Standards**: Establish principles resisting manipulation—no dark patterns in wallet onboarding, defaults favor user privacy not platform benefit, opt-in rather than opt-out for sensitive features, comprehension requirements before consent, unbundled choices allowing granular control. "Custom Setup" should be prominent with plain language, not buried with jargon implying security risks.

- **Inference Guardrails and Illegibility Protections**: Limit behavioral and emotional profiling from credential patterns. Technical approaches: differential privacy on verification queries, k-anonymity for presentation patterns, purpose limitation preventing cross-context correlation, unlinkability preventing tracking. Policy approaches: consent requirements before pattern analysis, prohibitions on emotional state inference, transparency for algorithmic processing. Critical question: How do we enable **intentional illegibility**—the right NOT to be categorized, predicted, or made legible to surveillance?

- **Polycentric and Contestable Governance**: Design preventing authority consolidation through distribution, competition, accountability. No single trust registry controls participation; multiple governance models compete with exit rights; decisions contestable through transparent processes with community representation; platform terms cannot change unilaterally without user consent or migration rights. Enable "popular digital sovereignty from below" (grassroots participation) not "sovereignty-as-a-service" (platform provision).

- **Identity Pluralism and Schema Flexibility:** Support diverse identity models beyond narrow or Western-centric categories—non-binary gender markers, “none of the above” options, [relationship-based and collective credentials](../relational-autonomy/), and culturally specific schemas. SSI architectures should enable but not mandate categorization. Forced classification into inadequate boxes is a form of coercion; schema pluralism is an anti-coercion strategy.

#### **6. How This Lens Might Inform the 2026 SSI Principles**

**Core Principle Proposal**:

> **Coercion Resistance** (New Principle)
>
> SSI systems must protect individuals from coercion across four dimensions: **interface** (dark patterns, manipulative defaults, deceptive design), **inference** (behavioral profiling creating conformity pressure), **structural** (platform lock-in, credential dependencies, exit penalties), and **cognitive** (surveillance creating self-censorship, chilling effects on authentic expression).
>
> Technical architecture should prevent coercion, not just prohibit it through policy. This includes: non-coercive interface design standards, inference guardrails (differential privacy, purpose limitation, consent before pattern analysis), portability standards (exit without prohibitive costs, interoperable formats), and polycentric governance (distributed authority, contestable decisions), cognitive freedom (liberty—protecting mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity, and self-determination) . **Coercion resistance requires ongoing practice**—interface audits, inference monitoring, governance accountability—not one-time design claim.

**Rationale**: Decentralized architecture alone doesn't prevent coercion operating through interface manipulation, behavioral profiling, structural dependencies, and psychological internalization. Current SSI principles address cryptographic privacy but don't systematically address coercion across its full spectrum. Comprehensive coercion resistance requires coordination across specialized lenses (Self-Coercion, Choice Architecture, Context Boundaries) under unified meta-framework.

**Integration**: This meta-lens coordinates with specialized lenses—[Self-Coercion](../self-coercion/) (psychological internalization), [Choice Architecture](../choice-architecture/) (structural lock-in), [Context Boundaries](../context-boundaries/) (inference-based profiling)—to provide comprehensive coercion resistance framework. Together they address coercion's full spectrum rather than isolated dimensions.

#### **8. Open Questions & Questions for the Broader Community**

### Open Questions

1. **Detecting Emergent Patterns**: How do we recognize and measure coercive patterns in identity ecosystems, especially subtle or emergent ones? What early warning indicators signal coercion forming?

2. **Anti-Paternalism Tension**: How can anti-coercion safeguards prevent coercion without becoming paternalistic—restricting choices "for people's own good"? Who decides what counts as unacceptable coercion?

3. **Persuasion vs. Coercion**: Where does persuasion end and coercion begin? In interface design, in governance, in social pressure? Can we distinguish legitimate influence from manipulative pressure?

### Questions for the Broader Community

1. **Inference Constraints**: To what extent can technical anti-correlation protections constrain behavioral and emotional inferences, especially when inference can occur independently of SSI systems? What are the architectural limits?

2. **Cognitive Liberty**: Should cognitive freedom (mental privacy, integrity, continuity, self-determination) be a separate lens updating SSI principles, or is it an essential dimension of coercion resistance? Does it warrant architectural separation?
