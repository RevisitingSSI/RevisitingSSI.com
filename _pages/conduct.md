Creating the future of human identity requires more than shared principles, it demands a culture of collaboration that embodies those principles. As we navigate different approaches to transformation, from building alternatives to reforming institutions, we need common ground for how we engage with each other.

This code isn't about enforcing uniformity or stifling debate. It's about maintaining a space where diverse tactics can be discussed productively, where vulnerability in admitting uncertainty is met with support rather than attack, and where the work can progress despite (and because of) our differences.

We explicitly reject communication styles that undermine collaborative work: the adversarial posturing common in tech, the dominance games of legal debate, the point-scoring that passes for discourse in too many spaces. These patterns of treating conversation as combat, using intelligence as a weapon, and mistaking aggression for rigor destroy the trust required for revolutionary work.

We've chosen minimal, trust-based norms over legalistic rules because we believe in treating each other as capable collaborators rather than problems to be managed. The following guidelines foster the conditions for real collaboration: where people can propose bold ideas without defensive armor, admit ignorance without losing face, and change their minds without shame.

## Respect

* Treat all members with dignity and respect, regardless of background, identity, or beliefs.
* Communicate with care. Styles that are aggressive, adversarial, or overly critical, even if common in some professional or cultural contexts, can undermine trust and collaboration here.
* Respect the privacy of others, both personal and digital.
* What's shared here stays here. Don't quote members elsewhere without permission. You may discuss ideas from the group, but keep them anonymous: members have different risk profiles, and careless attribution could cause real harm.

## Constructive Communication

* Be open to new ideas and willing to learn from each other.
* In moments of disagreement, aim to stay focused on shared goals and values. It's okay to "agree to disagree."
* Avoid inflammatory language, personal attacks, or behavior that disrupts the group's purpose.

## Inclusion

* Everyone should feel welcome to participate. Be mindful of different backgrounds and communication styles.
* Avoid unnecessary jargon or acronyms: clarity helps everyone stay on the same page.
* Practice balance in conversation: contribute without dominating.
* Let others speak and listen actively.

## Scope & Moderation

* Free expression is welcome, but it doesn't override group norms.
* If behavior in the group troubles you, you have options: address it directly with the person involved, bring it to the host privately, or if appropriate, raise it for group discussion.
* The host will consider concerns in context and aim to keep the group functional, not to run trials.
* Concerns are about public behavior in this space, not private conversations elsewhere.
