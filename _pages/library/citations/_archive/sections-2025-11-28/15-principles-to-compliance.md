  > **BRIEF**: Most comprehensive attempt to operationalize SSI—42 testable properties bridging principles and regulatory compliance, revealing both value and risks.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Pattiyanon and Aoki present CSSPS (Compliance SSI System Property Set), a framework of 42 verifiable properties addressing the gap between self-sovereign identity principles and legal/regulatory compliance. Through systematic analysis, they demonstrate current SSI systems fail to meet information security and privacy requirements mandated by laws and technical standards. CSSPS organizes properties into five hierarchical categories with detailed constraint expressions. The modular framework allows selective adoption based on regulatory contexts, enabling organizations to implement property subsets while maintaining SSI's core values.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Most comprehensive attempt to operationalize SSI—42 testable properties bridging principles and regulatory compliance. Study critically as case study: successful operationalization (IP16 consent, IP17 minimization, IP21 confidentiality) and problematic interpretation (IP1 reverses Existence principle). Reveals compliance is predominantly security engineering challenge (38% of properties security-related).

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational 10 SSI principles that operationalization frameworks build upon—essential for understanding original intent vs. subsequent interpretations.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen establishes self-sovereign identity framework through historical analysis showing centralized, federated, and user-centric identity systems failed to give individuals true control. Proposes ten principles (Existence, Control, Access, Transparency, Persistence, Portability, Interoperability, Consent, Minimalization, Protection) as criteria for genuinely sovereign systems. Grounds identity in Descartes' *cogito ergo sum* and cryptographic precedents like PGP's Web of Trust, establishing SSI as technical infrastructure and human rights framework.

Essential for understanding original intent vs. subsequent interpretations. "Users must have an independent existence" meant identity precedes systems—contrast with CSSPS IP1's reversal demonstrates operationalization risk.

  > **BRIEF**: Provides legal framework (agency law) for operationalizing SSI through enforceable duties rather than technical properties alone.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen analyzes Wyoming's SF0039—first U.S. legal definition of digital identity using "principal authority" to import Agency law precedent. Reframes 10 SSI principles as rights (existence, control, persistence, consent), identity duties (access, transparency, portability, interoperability, minimization, protection), and Agency duties (specificity, responsibility, representation, fidelity, disclosure). Grounds SSI in peer-to-peer relationships mediated by state rather than property law's state sovereignty.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Provides legal framework (agency law) for operationalizing SSI through enforceable duties rather than technical properties alone. Multiple operationalization methodologies needed—technical properties (CSSPS), legal duties (Principal Authority), harm-based assessment, user-centric metrics address different dimensions.

  > **BRIEF**: Technology-neutral legal framework showing how existing law applies to cryptographic systems—establishes Tier 2 regulatory requirements.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen proposes model legislation for state digital policy structured in four layers: Layer 0 (Cryptographic Secret Protection—preventing forced key disclosure), Layer 1 (Digital Signature and Assent), Layer 2 (Cryptographically Verifiable Records as self-authenticating evidence), and Layer 3 (Digital Identity Recognition via verifiable credentials). The framework translates technical distinctions into legal categories, includes anti-coercion provisions and portability requirements, and can be adopted incrementally at no cost.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Technology-neutral legal framework showing how existing law (agency, evidence, contracts) applies to cryptographic systems. Four coordinated acts establish Tier 2 regulatory requirements: cryptographic secret protection, digital signature validity, self-authentication of verifiable records, credential recognition. Critical anti-coercion provisions address platform abuses.
