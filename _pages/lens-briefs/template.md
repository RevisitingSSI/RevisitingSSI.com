This template guides Working Circles in creating **Lens Exploration Briefs** for the #RevisitingSSI project. Briefs help the community understand your lens, why it matters, and how it may inform the 2026 SSI Principles.

## 1. Territory / Focus Summary

**Purpose:** Establish what your lens examines and why it matters.

### Required Elements

- **Opening Frame (1–2 paragraphs):** Begin with an engaging narrative, concrete example, or philosophical grounding that introduces the lens’s core concerns.
- **Labeled Central Insight or Question (bolded):** For example:
  - **The core insight:** …
  - **Central question:** …
- **Concrete Grounding:** Provide specific mechanisms, scenarios, or lived experiences showing how your lens manifests.
- **Depth:** Use 4–7 paragraphs. Avoid superficial overviews.

### Quality Indicators
- Reader can visualize concrete scenarios.
- Central insight is explicitly labeled.
- Territory shows depth and contextual grounding.

## 2. Relationship to Other Lenses

**Purpose:** Clarify how your lens connects to, builds upon, or differs from other lenses.

### Key Elements
- Distinctions from nearby lenses.
- Complementary relationships.
- Integration notes revealing how insights constrain or inform other lenses.

### Depth
1–2 developed paragraphs.

## 3. Why This Lens Matters for SSI

**Purpose:** Connect your lens to SSI architecture and practice.

### Required Elements
- **The architectural gap:** What current SSI approaches miss.
- **Concrete SSI examples:** Wallets, verification patterns, governance models, real harms.
- **Design implications:** Why this requires architectural consideration, not only policy.

Avoid abstract claims without examples.

## 4. Key Harms, Risks, or Questions

**Purpose:** Identify concrete risks that arise when the lens is ignored.

### Requirements
- 3–6 major harms or risks.
- Each with enough narrative to understand operation and impact.
- At least one extended scenario.

Build on Section 3 without duplicating it.

## 5. Constructive Directions, Requirements, or Mitigations

**Purpose:** Offer strategic pathways forward.

### Requirements
- 3–8 strategic directions, each with meaningful development.
- Can include rights, governance patterns, design principles, regulatory considerations.
- Should relate clearly to identified harms.

Frame as provocations, not final solutions.

## 6. How This Lens Might Inform the 2026 SSI Principles

**Purpose:** Propose refinements or additions to SSI principles.

### Required Elements
- 2–3 draft principles with concrete wording.
- Connection to harms identified earlier.
- Rationale grounded in lens theory and evidence.

### Format Example

**Principle: [Name]**

> [Principle text]

**Addresses harms:** …

**Rationale:** …

## 7. Selected Resources

**Purpose:** Provide foundational literature.

### Requirements
- **Minimum 4 resources** (aim for 5–6).
- **All citations must have working URLs.**
- Order from foundational theory → SSI literature → applied work.
- Include short abstracts where available.

### Format
```
* _**Title**_ (Year). [type]. _Author(s)._ Publication details. Available from: <URL>.

  > **BRIEF:** Why this matters.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT:** 2–4 sentences.
```

## 8. Open Questions & Questions for the Broader Community *(Optional)*

### Open Questions

**Purpose:** Identify unresolved issues your Circle is actively grappling with.
- 2–5 questions grounded within the lens.
- Represent genuine uncertainty.

### Questions for the Broader Community

**Purpose:** Identify questions requiring cross-lens or community-wide discussion.
- 2–4 questions needing broader deliberation.

## General Guidelines

- **Tone:** Professional, accessible, interdisciplinary.
- **Length:** 1500–3000 words typically.
- **Audience:** SSI-literate participants from diverse fields.
- **Integration:** Reference related lenses explicitly in Section 2.
- **Version Control:** Update version number when making substantial edits.
