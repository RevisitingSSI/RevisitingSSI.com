  > **BRIEF**: Utah's State-Endorsed Digital Identity framework establishing privacy-first, decentralized principles where identity belongs to individuals, not governments.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Utah's State-Endorsed Digital Identity (SEDI) white paper outlines a digital identity framework where identity is inherent to individuals rather than created by governments or corporations. The framework requires individuals fully control their digital identifiers while the state endorses and protects identity. Six major principles include privacy through decentralization, minimal data sharing, no tracking by other parties, and strong governance. SB260 (2025) codified these principles, making Utah a leader in privacy-protective digital identity implementation.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Stewardship Lens)_: Demonstrates platform recognition of stewardship duties—decentralized architecture prevents surveillance while supporting vulnerable populations who cannot manage credentials independently. However, concerns remain about permanence (credentials accumulate over 18 years without child consent), verification gaps (parental authority rarely validated), and weaponization risk in authoritarian contexts.

  > **BRIEF**: Explores guardianship necessity for SSI inclusivity given 2.9 billion without internet access; warns about "safeguarding dystopia."

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: The Sovrin Guardianship Task Force explores why guardianship is essential for self-sovereign identity inclusivity, given 2.9 billion people (37% of world population) have never used the internet. Using real-world examples, the paper defines guardianship types, mandates, and contextual considerations for transferring partial or complete wallet control. Identifies critical risks including theft, impersonation, and identity data commingling. The V2 update (May 2023) provides implementation guidelines and technical requirements for policy makers, designers, lawyers, and developers implementing guardianship solutions.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Stewardship Lens)_: Warns about "safeguarding dystopia" where protection becomes restriction—disabled adults facing restrictive controls justified as safety, children under total monitoring framed as parental rights. Provides framework for graduated guardianship matching user capacity and oversight mechanisms preventing abuse.

  > **BRIEF**: Examines tension between children's privacy rights and parental freedom; documents sharenting harms including identity theft and permanent digital footprints.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Vanessa Cordeiro examines the tension between children's privacy rights and parental freedom of expression in digital environments. Defines "sharenting" as caregivers transmitting private details about children via digital channels, noting most children develop online presence before their first birthday. Identifies four harm categories: tangible dangers (identity theft, digital kidnapping), fundamental rights violations, digital citizenship impacts, and psychological damage. By 2030, over 66% of identity fraud cases may stem from sharenting. Advocates for "right to be forgotten" mechanisms and recognizing children as autonomous individuals deserving consent regarding their digital presence.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Stewardship Lens)_: Documents how children have no opt-out from digital identities parents create—permanent footprints without consent, identity theft risks, future backlash from personas they never authorized. Critical for understanding why stewardship requires children's future revocation rights.

  > **BRIEF**: Policy guidance on digital ID risks across 27 countries; recommends Human Rights Impact Assessments and meaningful participation of at-risk populations.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Open Government Partnership policy guidance based on 2023 CIPIT study assessing digital ID systems across 27 countries in Africa, Balkans, Central Asia, Latin America, and South/Southeast Asia. Found 22 countries adopted digital ID, many with biometrics. Identifies key risks: data breaches threatening privacy, exclusion of marginalized communities, and state surveillance facilitation. Without due process, individuals face compromised identities, theft, extortion, and harassment. Recommends limiting centralized repositories, requiring judicial warrants for access, mandating public disclosure of procurement contracts, and restricting permitted uses of collected information.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Stewardship Lens)_: Documents how digital identity systems replicate exclusionary practices—37% lack internet access (disproportionately women, refugees, poor). Provides expert recommendations: Human Rights Impact Assessments, mandatory non-digital alternatives, meaningful participation of at-risk populations. Essential for understanding systemic discrimination stewardship must prevent.

### Srnicek (2016) Platform Capitalism *(draft)*

* _**Platform Capitalism**_ (2016). [book]. _Srnicek, Nick._ Polity Press. ISBN: 9781509504862. 120 pages.

  > **TAGS**: #PlatformCapitalism #DigitalEconomy #DataExtraction #TechMonopolies #SrnicekNick #PlatformEconomics #Capitalism #TechIndustry

  > **BRIEF**: Examines how platforms extract data as fundamental resource while creating dependency structures masked as "free services."

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Srnicek examines how companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are transforming into platforms—businesses providing hardware and software foundations for others to operate on. This shift signals major changes in capitalist operations, with platforms extracting data as the fundamental new resource. The book traces platform emergence from the 1970s downturn through the 2008 crisis, showing how monopolistic platforms now control foundational economic infrastructure.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Stewardship Lens)_: Platform capitalism creates dependency structures where "free services" mask data extraction and lock-in. For stewardship, this reveals how platforms position themselves as benevolent stewards while extracting value from vulnerable populations. SSI stewardship must avoid replicating platform patterns where "protection" becomes extraction, and "care" becomes surveillance infrastructure.
