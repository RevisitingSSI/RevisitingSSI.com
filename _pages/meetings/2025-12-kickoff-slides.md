# Part 1

## The Ten-Year Question

---

<!-- .slide: id="year-2016" -->

## April 2016

I published ten principles for self-sovereign identity.

They were aspirational—a compass, not a map.

---

<!-- .slide: id="movement" -->

## The Movement (2016–2021)

The principles caught fire.

- Hundreds of articles and academic papers
- Broad acceptance among technologists, policymakers, advocates
- W3C working groups, government pilots, enterprise interest

**A global community formed around<br/>decentralized digital identity**

### _The principles inspired people_

---

<!-- .slide: id="success" -->

## Technical Success…

- DIDs: W3C Recommendation ✓
- Verifiable Credentials: Standard ✓
- Government pilots: Dozens ✓

The architecture worked. The standards shipped.

But somewhere along the way…

### _The principles got lost_

---

<!-- .slide: id="crisis" -->

## What Went Wrong

- Focused on _**privacy**_ instead of what privacy defends: _**resisting coercion**_
- Followed the money. Death by 1000 compromises
- `did:web`—“decentralized” in name only
- Google & Apple and winning with more resources & centralized solutions
- Governments focused on _“Four Horsemen”_<br/>_(terror, pedophilia, drugs, money)_ while the real threat is **autocracy**

---

<!-- .slide: id="crisis-2" -->

## The Result

* We hoped to _**reduce**_ centralized power

* But we became indistinguishable from the very systems we set out to disrupt

> “If we can’t maintain semantic integrity of ’decentralized’ in our own community, how can we fight for it in the larger world?”

We may have _**increased**_ centralized power

---

<!-- .slide: id="question" -->

## The Question

* _What did we get right?_

* _What did we miss?_

* _What must change for the next decade?_

---

<!-- .slide: id="why-you" -->

## Why You’re Here

We need diverse expertise:

- Technologists + Lawyers
- Advocates + Academics
- Policy experts + Lived experience

_**We are not building specs—<br/>we are doing a strategic inquiry**_

---

<!-- .slide: id="introductions" -->

## Quick Introductions

Raise your Zoom hand to share:

1. **Name** & **affiliation** *(if any)*
2. **One sentence**: What brings you to this work?

*~30 seconds each • I’ll go first to model*

<small>_I’m Christopher Allen of Blockchain Commons.<br/>I wrote the original ten principles in 2016.<br/>I’m here because I believe we lost our way—<br/>and this community can help us find it again._</small>

Note:

**If someone runs long:**
“Thank you—great context! Who’s next?”

**After 10-12 intros:**
“We won’t get to everyone now, but you’ll introduce yourselves in your working circles. Let’s continue.”
Note: end-speaker-notes

<!-- .slide: id="outputs" -->

## What We’ll Produce

| Phase | Output | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Lens Briefs | Dec–Jan |
| 2 | Drafts of Papers | Feb–Apr |
| 3 | <u>**Revised Principles**</u> <br/>_(Exactly ten years<br/>after the original)_ | April 26th, 2026 |
| 4 | Papers and articles based<br/>on the Revised Principles| May-Dec |

# Part 2

## The 15 Lenses

---

<!-- .slide: id="what-lenses" -->

## What Are Lenses?

Each lens reveals something the others miss.

No single lens is complete.

Each working circle goes _**deep on one**_<br/>while staying aware of the whole.

---

<!-- .slide: id="four-categories" -->

## Four Categories

1. **Foundational Principles & Rights** (4)
2. **Preventing Coercion** (4)
3. **Relational & Contextual Identity** (4)
4. **Compliance, Governance & Technical** (3)

---

<!-- .slide: id="category1" -->

## Category 1: Foundational Principles & Rights

What makes identity a _**right**_</br>rather than a privilege?

<font size=6>
    
- **Irreducible Person** — Existence before encoding
- **Anti-Property** — Identity cannot be owned or sold
- **Right to Transact** — Digital participation as constitutional right
- **Cryptographic Paradigms** — Assumptions that shape possibility

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="irreducible-person" -->

## 1. Irreducible Person

### Core insight:
Existence isn’t earned or proven—it simply *is*.

### Key question:
How do we protect dignity from being made measurable?

*Example: Aadhaar biometric exclusion—existence conditioned on encoding*

----

<!-- .slide: id="anti-property" -->

## 2. Anti-Property

### Core insight:
Identity cannot be owned, bought, sold, or treated as property.

### Key question:
How do we resist “data ownership” commodification?

*“Owning your data” legitimizes markets that shouldn’t exist*

----

<!-- .slide: id="right-to-transact" -->

## 3. Right to Transact

### Core insight:
Digital participation is a constitutional right.

### Key question:
How do we prevent exclusion by gatekeepers?

*Operation Choke Point 2.0: Banks weaponized as censors*

----

<!-- .slide: id="crypto-paradigms" -->

## 4. Cryptographic Paradigms

### Core insight:
PKI assumptions constrained us for 36 years.

### Key question:
What assumptions are we embedding now that will limit 2036?

*What can’t we invent because current paradigms block it?*

---

<!-- .slide: id="category2" -->

## Category 2: Preventing Coercion

How do systems compel behavior—</br>and how do we resist?

<font size=6>
    
- **Coercion Resistance** — Privacy defends against force
- **Self-Coercion** — When control feels like your own idea
- **Choice Architecture** — Small choices become structural traps
- **Binding Commitments** — When constraint enables trust

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="coercion-resistance" -->

## 5. Coercion Resistance

### Core insight:
Privacy is the shield. Coercion resistance is the goal.

### Four dimensions:
- Interface (dark patterns)
- Inference (profiling)
- Structural (lock-in)
- Psychological (self-censorship)

----

<!-- .slide: id="self-coercion" -->

## 6. Self-Coercion

### Core insight:
The most effective control feels like your own idea.

### Key question:
How do we counter chilling effects?

*You modify behavior based on imagined consequences—no rule needed*

----

<!-- .slide: id="choice-architecture" -->

## 7. Choice Architecture

### Core insight:
Small voluntary choices accumulate into structural dependency.

### Key question:
How do we ensure real exit rights?

*“The 18-year trap”: Credentials that won’t transfer*

----

<!-- .slide: id="binding-commitments" -->

## 8. Binding Commitments

### Core insight:
Not all lock-in is harmful. Voluntary constraint enables trust.

### Key question:
When is commitment productive vs. exploitative?

*Kenyan chamas: 200,000+ groups managing $1.7B through mutual stakes*

---

<!-- .slide: id="category3" -->

## Category 3: Relational & Contextual Identity

Identity exists in relationship:<br/>to others, to context, to scale.

<font size=6>
    
- **Relational Autonomy** — “I am because we are”
- **Context Boundaries** — Keeping life spheres distinct
- **Multi-Scalar Sovereignty** — Individual, community, nation
- **Stewardship** — Caring for those who cannot consent

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="relational-autonomy" -->

## 9. Relational Autonomy

### Core insight:
“I am because we are” —Ubuntu philosophy

### Key question:
How do we credential relationships, not just attributes?

*Immigration systems separate families;<br>bonds are invisible*

----

<!-- .slide: id="context-boundaries" -->

## 10. Context Boundaries

### Core insight:
Your employer shouldn’t see therapy notes.

### Key question:
How do we prevent correlation attacks?

*Unlinkable identifiers keep life spheres cryptographically distinct*

----

<!-- .slide: id="multi-scalar" -->

## 11. Multi-Scalar Sovereignty

### Core insight:
Sovereignty operates at individual, community, AND national scales.

### Key question:
How do we prevent re-centralization?

*Technical distribution ≠ political distribution*

----

<!-- .slide: id="stewardship" -->

## 12. Stewardship

### Core insight:
When caring for others’ identity, are we empowering or exploiting?

### Key question:
How do we protect those who can’t exit or refuse?

*18 years of credential accumulation without child consent*

---

<!-- .slide: id="category4" -->

## Category 4: Compliance, Governance & Technical

How do our principles survive contact<br/>with law, standards, and power?

<font size=6>
    
- **Principles to Compliance** — Not everything can be measured
- **Regulatory Frameworks** — Voluntary erodes to mandatory
- **Principal Authority** — Restoring accountability to agents

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="principles-compliance" -->

## 13. Principles to Compliance

### Core insight:
Not everything important can be measured.

### Key question:
What must remain ethical commitment vs. technical test?

*Treating all principles as measurable destroys the ones that matter most*

----

<!-- .slide: id="regulatory" -->

## 14. Regulatory Frameworks

### Core insight:
Legal “voluntary” erodes to practical “mandatory”

### Key question:
How do we enable SSI without mandating it?

*Utah model: Recognition without government monopoly*

----

<!-- .slide: id="principal-authority" -->

## 15. Principal Authority

### Core insight:
Platforms violate every duty agents owe principals.

### Key question:
How do we restore accountability?

*Centuries of agency law—enforceable duties of care, loyalty, disclosure*

---

<!-- .slide: id="connections" -->

## Lens Connections

These aren’t silos.

- Stewardship ↔ Relational Autonomy
- Coercion Resistance threads through everything
- Context Boundaries ↔ Multi-Scalar Sovereignty

Each brief acknowledges connections while going deep on one

---

<!-- .slide: id="briefs-status" -->

## These Are Starting Points

The lens briefs are early drafts—<br/>**provocations, not conclusions**

- New lenses may emerge from your work
- We won’t tackle all equally, and that’s okay
- Coverage will be organic, based on interest and expertise

**Each working circle will take ownership<br/>of where the lens goes next.**

---

<!-- .slide: id="part3" -->

# Part 3

## What Working Circles Will Do

---

<!-- .slide: id="circles" -->

## Working Circles

**Size:** 2-5 members (3–4 ideal)

**Composition:** Seek diversity<br/>
*Technical + Policy + Advocacy + Academic*

**Commitment:** 2–3 sessions × 90 minutes

**Goal:** Rough consensus on worthy insights, not standards, specs, or product designs

*Ground your work in references or<br/>lived experience, not speculation*

---

<!-- .slide: id="brief-template" -->

## The Lens Brief Template

<font size=6>

1. **Territory / Focus** — Core insight, concrete grounding
2. **Relationship to Other Lenses** — Connections, distinctions
3. **Why This Matters for SSI** — Architectural gaps, design implications
4. **Harms, Risks, Questions** — What goes wrong when ignored
5. **Constructive Directions** — Strategic pathways forward
6. **2026 Principles** — Draft principle language
7. **Resources** — Foundational literature

*1500–3000 words • Full template at revisitingssi.com*
</font>

---

<!-- .slide: id="beyond-brief" -->

## Beyond the Lens Brief

**Phase 2 (selective):** Strong briefs may advance to:
- Full academic paper
- Policy brief
- Principles synthesis

**Credit:** Substantial contribution = authorship

---

<!-- .slide: id="stakes" -->

## The Stakes

Your work informs principles published

### _April 26th, 2026_

Exactly ten years after the original.

These will guide digital identity systems
affecting **billions of people**.

---

<!-- .slide: id="part4" -->

# Part 4

## Workshop Activity

---

<!-- .slide: id="breakout1" -->

## Small Group Warm-Up

*Zoom will auto-assign you to rooms (3 people each)*

In your breakout:

1. Introduce yourselves briefly
2. Each share:<br/>_“If you had to focus on **one lens just for today**—no long-term commitment—which would you choose and why”_?

*~10 minutes*

---

<!-- .slide: id="report-chat" -->

## Share Your Interest

When you return:

1. **Type in chat:** Your chosen lens for today
2. I’ll call out lenses with 2+ people
3. When yours is called, share your “why” (~30 sec)

*Starting with the most popular*

---

<!-- .slide: id="breakout2" -->

## Lens Deep-Dive *(time permitting)*

*Choose your room—named for each active lens*

Your task:

- Discuss: <br/>_**“What’s the biggest risk if this lens is ignored?”**_

- Pick someone to report back

*~10 minutes*

---

<!-- .slide: id="lens-reports" -->

## Lens Reports

One person from each room:

- Which lens?
- What risk did you identify?

*~30 seconds each*

---

<!-- .slide: id="momentum" -->

## Where’s the Energy?

Based on what we heard:

- Which lenses have momentum?
- Who wants to continue working on these?
- Any lenses we should combine or table for now?

*This shapes our working circles going forward*

---

<!-- .slide: id="part5" -->

# Part 5

## Next Steps

---

<!-- .slide: id="two-kickoffs" -->

## Two Kickoffs, One Community

**Today:** EU/US timezone-friendly

**Next week:** Asia/EU timezone-friendly

Working circles may form at either—or span both.

*Cross-timezone? Work asynchronously or find overlapping hours*

---

<!-- .slide: id="whats-next" -->

## What’s Next

**If your working circle has momentum:**

- Announce on GitHub Discussions
- Seek diverse points-of-view<br/>_(from workshop or invite from outside)_
- Schedule your first session

**Still exploring?**

- Share interest on GitHub Discussions or Signal
- Connect at next week’s Asia/EU kickoff

*No pressure to commit to a circle today*

---

<!-- .slide: id="how-we-work" -->

## How We Work

* **Licensing:** All outputs CC-BY 4.0
   * *Open for others to build on*

* **Conduct:** What’s shared here stays here
  * *Don’t quote members without permission*.
  * **See also RevisitingSSI.com/conduct**

* **Facilitation:** I’m the initial host, facilitator, <br/>and academic referee

---

<!-- .slide: id="closing" -->

## Closing

The original principles were written by one person
in a moment of inspiration.

These revised principles will emerge from
**a community wrestling honestly with hard questions**.
