### Allen (2016) Path to Self-Sovereign Identity

* _**The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2016). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity [blog], April 26, 2016, updated 2020. Retrieved 2025-11-12 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/>. Cross-posted to CoinDesk, April 27, 2016.

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational 2016 article establishing 10 principles of self-sovereign identity and tracing identity system evolution from centralized to user-centric to self-sovereign models.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen establishes self-sovereign identity framework through historical analysis showing centralized, federated, and user-centric identity systems failed to give individuals true control. Proposes ten principles (Existence, Control, Access, Transparency, Persistence, Portability, Interoperability, Consent, Minimalization, Protection) as criteria for genuinely sovereign systems. Grounds identity in Descartes' *cogito ergo sum* and cryptographic precedents like PGP's Web of Trust, establishing SSI as technical infrastructure and human rights framework.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: Principle 1 (Existence): "Users must have an independent existence"—the ineffable "I" that precedes and transcends digital representations. This lens examines what happens when protective constraints like Principle 1 are operationalized against their original purpose.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: The original 10 SSI principles—analyze what paradigm assumptions they embedded. Understanding what was assumed in 2016 reveals what we might unknowingly assume in 2026.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Foundational 10 SSI principles that operationalization frameworks build upon. Essential for understanding original intent vs. subsequent interpretations.

### Allen (2021) Principal Authority

* _**Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2021). [article]. _Allen, Christopher (with Shannon Appelcline)._ Life With Alacrity [blog], September 15, 2021. Retrieved 2025-11-20 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/principal-authority/>.

  > **TAGS**: [#SSI](by-tag#ssi-11) [#AgencyLaw](by-tag#agencylaw-2) [#PrincipalAuthority](by-tag#principalauthority-1) [#Wyoming](by-tag#wyoming-1) [#SF0039](by-tag#sf0039-1) [#LegalFramework](by-tag#legalframework-2) [#Delegation](by-tag#delegation-2) [#FiduciaryDuty](by-tag#fiduciaryduty-3) [#AllenChristopher](by-tag#allenchristopher-8) [#DigitalIdentity](by-tag#digitalidentity-13)

  > **BRIEF**: Analyzes Wyoming SF0039's legal grounding of digital identity in Agency law, reorganizing SSI principles as Principal rights and Agent duties.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen analyzes Wyoming's SF0039—first U.S. legal definition of digital identity using "principal authority" to import Agency law precedent. Reframes 10 SSI principles as rights (existence, control, persistence, consent), identity duties (access, transparency, portability, interoperability, minimization, protection), and Agency duties (specificity, responsibility, representation, fidelity, disclosure). Grounds SSI in peer-to-peer relationships mediated by state rather than property law's state sovereignty.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: Wyoming SF0039 provides first U.S. legal definition grounding digital identity in Agency law—importing centuries of common law precedent rather than requiring novel legislation. Reorganizes SSI principles into Principal rights and Agent duties with legal teeth.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Provides agency law framework where delegation with accountability enables genuine exit rights.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Provides legal framework (agency law) for operationalizing SSI through enforceable duties rather than technical properties alone.

### Allen (2021) SSI: 5 Years On

* _**Self-Sovereign Identity: 5 Years On**_ (2021). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life with Alacrity [blog], April 26, 2021. Retrieved 2025-11-16 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/SSI-5-Years-On/>. Also: CoinDesk <https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/26/self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on/>.

  > **BRIEF**: Five-year SSI retrospective finds W3C success with mission drift toward institutional surveillance over refugee protection.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Christopher Allen's 5-year retrospective assesses self-sovereign identity's evolution from conceptual framework to W3C-standardized infrastructure. He celebrates achievements—principles adoption across governments, VCs and DIDs nearing standardization, diverse ecosystem emergence—while identifying critical drift toward Legally-Enabled Self-Sovereign (LESS) Identity serving institutions rather than Trust Minimized Identity protecting refugees and vulnerable populations.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Introduces LESS vs Trust Minimized Identity dichotomy—institutional SSI (high-trust environments) vs human rights SSI (adversarial environments) require explicit bifurcation not compromise synthesis.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Documents mission drift pattern where technical standardization success coincides with value compromise—funding asymmetries make refugee marginalization economic inevitability.

### Allen (2023) Origins of SSI

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2023). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life with Alacrity blog. Retrieved 2025-11-14 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/origins-SSI/>.

  > **BRIEF**: Allen traces SSI origins to five traditions: sovereignty, living systems, commons governance, feminist theory, and human rights.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen documents intellectual genealogy underlying his 2016 SSI principles, synthesizing five theoretical traditions: historical sovereignty (peer negotiation not isolation), living systems theory (selective membranes balancing autonomy and exchange), Ostrom's commons governance (collective self-governance without centralization), feminist political theory (sovereignty as agency not domination), and human rights framework (universal dignity). Positions SSI as political response to digital serfdom.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: All five SSI foundation traditions emphasize autonomy requires relationships—self-sovereignty means capacity to engage as peer in relationships users control, not isolation.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Living Systems Theory provides "selective membrane" design pattern—dynamic boundaries controlling what crosses while maintaining integrity—foundational for SSI architectural decisions.

### Allen (2024) Edge Identifiers

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: Edge Identifiers & Cliques**_ (2024). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity [blog], October 8, 2024. Retrieved 2025-11-20 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/cliques-1/>.

  > **TAGS**: [#EdgeIdentifiers](by-tag#edgeidentifiers-2) [#Cliques](by-tag#cliques-2) [#Cryptography](by-tag#cryptography-2) [#MuSig2](by-tag#musig2-2) [#FROST](by-tag#frost-3) [#SchnorrSignatures](by-tag#schnorrsignatures-1) [#RelationalIdentity](by-tag#relationalidentity-3) [#SSI](by-tag#ssi-11) [#AllenChristopher](by-tag#allenchristopher-8) [#MultiPartyComputation](by-tag#multipartycomputation-3)

  > **BRIEF**: Proposes relationship-based cryptographic identity using edge identifiers and cliques with Schnorr multisig protocols.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen challenges single-signature cryptographic identity, proposing relationship-based alternatives using Schnorr aggregatable multisig (MuSig2, FROST). He introduces edge identifiers (pairwise relationship keys) and cryptographic cliques (fully connected group keys) where identity emerges from relationships rather than individual keys. This "Relationship Signature Paradigm" distributes keys as cryptographic "fog" eliminating single points of failure, enables joint decision-making through unanimous consent, and models how identity actually forms through social connections.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Demonstrates relationship-aware SSI is technically feasible. Edge identifiers provide cryptographic substrate for bilateral consent and unilateral exit. Cliques enable group identity for chamas and communities.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Context Boundaries Lens)_: Edge identifiers enable context-specific relationship credentials that don't reveal other contexts. Different edge keys for work vs. family prevent correlation.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Demonstrates how paradigm shifts happen—not as incremental improvement but as reconceptualization. Shows what becomes possible when we question the assumption that identity must be individual.

### Allen (2024) Open & Fuzzy Cliques

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: Open & Fuzzy Cliques**_ (2024). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity [blog], October 16, 2024. Retrieved 2025-11-20 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/musings-of-a-trust-architect-open-and-fuzzy-cliques/>.

  > **BRIEF**: Extends cryptographic cliques with open (incomplete connectivity), fuzzy (threshold), and device variants for practical implementation.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen extends cryptographic cliques with three practical variants. Open cliques allow incomplete connectivity for realistic social modeling and organic growth. Fuzzy cliques use FROST threshold signatures enabling flexible m-of-n decision-making. Device cliques show how hardware, AIs, and automated systems can participate alongside humans. Compares FROST (flexibility via thresholds) vs. MuSig2 (accountability via unanimity) for implementation guidance.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Open cliques support fluid social modeling where not everyone is connected—realistic representation of actual relationships rather than artificial complete-graph requirements.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Technical Delegation Lens)_: Fuzzy cliques enable m-of-n authorization for different decision types (routine 1-of-3, important 2-of-3, critical 3-of-3)—cryptographic foundation for graduated delegation authority.

### Allen (2024) SSI Moral Bankruptcy

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: Has our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?**_ (2024). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life with Alacrity blog. Retrieved 2025-11-14 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/ssi-bankruptcy/>.

  > **BRIEF**: SSI originator argues ecosystem became morally bankrupt by abandoning founding principles for market adoption and surveillance-enabling compromises.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen argues SSI ecosystem became "morally bankrupt" by abandoning core ethical commitments for market adoption. Ecosystem adopted compromised specifications (did:web diminishing resilience), failed enforcing strict data minimization enabling over-identification, and became indistinguishable from surveillance systems it opposed. Connecting SSI to geopolitical threats (authoritarian expansion, marginalized persecution), argues purpose is protecting vulnerable populations not market success.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Originator critique framing SSI challenges as moral failure rather than market failure—ethical commitments violated regardless of adoption metrics.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: did:web "diminishes resilience and independence" through DNS, certificate authority, and hosting dependencies—reintroducing centralization SSI meant to resist.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Community "failed to counter Four Horsemen rhetoric" justifying surveillance while overlooking "far greater risk of tyranny against vulnerable populations."

  > **BRIEF**: Explores cryptographic capabilities enabling selective disclosure and delegated authority through derived keys, threshold signatures, and ZKPs.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen examines how cryptographic capabilities enable "club-like" selective membership and delegated authority. Key mechanisms: hierarchical deterministic (HD) key derivation (master key generates child keys with specific authorities, enables guardian→child authority transition), threshold signatures (K-of-N parties must cooperate, distributed authority preventing abuse), zero-knowledge proofs (prove credential possession without disclosure, selective revelation). Applications to SSI: parent derives keys for child's credentials at age milestones (graduated authority), threshold schemes for high-stakes credentials (prevent unilateral action), ZK proofs for selective disclosure.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Technical Delegation Lens)_: Explores cryptographic capabilities enabling selective disclosure and delegated authority through derived keys, threshold signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs. Demonstrates practical implementation patterns for SSI delegation.

  > **BRIEF**: Four-layer model legislation demonstrating technology-neutral regulatory approach with anti-coercion provisions and platform independence requirements.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen proposes model legislation for state digital policy structured in four layers: Layer 0 (Cryptographic Secret Protection—preventing forced key disclosure), Layer 1 (Digital Signature and Assent), Layer 2 (Cryptographically Verifiable Records as self-authenticating evidence), and Layer 3 (Digital Identity Recognition via verifiable credentials). The framework translates technical distinctions into legal categories, includes anti-coercion provisions and portability requirements, and can be adopted incrementally at no cost.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: Four-layer model legislation demonstrating technology-neutral regulatory approach. Includes anti-coercion provisions, platform independence requirements, and standards framework.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Technology-neutral legal framework showing how existing law applies to cryptographic systems. Critical anti-coercion provisions address platform abuses.

  > **BRIEF**: Establishes "infrastructure without infrastructure"—systems functioning autonomously without centralized control, mathematics over policy.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Christopher Allen addresses how centralized digital services repeatedly fail users through "enshittification"—documenting personal experience losing educational infrastructure when Yahoo acquired del.icio.us and Google shut down Reader. Proposes Exodus Protocols as systems operating without external dependencies through five design patterns: operate without centralized infrastructure, encode rules mathematically rather than through policy, make constraints load-bearing, preserve exit through portability via open standards, and work offline across time.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Establishes "infrastructure without infrastructure"—systems functioning autonomously without centralized control. "Mathematics over policy": fundamental capabilities as mathematical rights, not permissions granted by companies.

### Allen (2025) Right to Transact *(draft)*

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: The Right to Transact**_ (2025). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity. Available from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/musings-right-to-transact/>.

  > **BRIEF**: Frames transactional freedom as constitutional right grounded in assembly and association, not merely financial access.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen argues the right to transact is foundational to all other digital rights—if you can be prevented from participating in economic life, no other rights matter. Grounds this in constitutional rights to free assembly and association, warning that de-platforming from dominant payment systems and wallets means losing operational identity, not just service access. Proposes peer-to-peer transaction capability as irreducible right.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: Frames transactional freedom as constitutional right grounded in assembly and association. Essential reading for understanding why de-platforming threatens operational identity.

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates how government digital identity systems can preserve autonomy—addresses "voluntary in law" eroding to "mandatory in practice" pattern.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Christopher Allen examines Switzerland's e-ID adoption and proposes five anchors protecting personal autonomy and democratic sovereignty: (1) Preserve Choice by Design—voluntary participation with granular data sharing control; (2) Build Long-Term Architecture—20-year sustainability with data minimization; (3) Maintain Platform Independence—prevent Apple/Google surveillance through jurisdictional oversight; (4) Require Duties for Commercial Parties—strict purpose limitation and deletion requirements; (5) Implement Institutional Safeguards—independent governance protecting against government overreach and corporate misuse.

  > **BRIEF**: First bibliometric mapping of digital identity reveals seven fragmented streams with minimal cross-citation despite 7x publication growth.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Ante, Fischer, and Strehle present the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of digital identity research, examining 1,395 peer-reviewed articles (1980-2020) through co-citation analysis. The study reveals seven distinct research streams—cryptography, privacy, authentication, encryption, IoT security, and blockchain identity—with minimal cross-pollination (12% average inter-stream citation) despite 7x publication growth from 2015-2020. Self-sovereign identity emerges within the blockchain stream but shows limited engagement with foundational cryptography and privacy literature.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Documents SSI research fragmentation from foundational cryptographic literature—only 8% cite identity-based encryption, 15% cite anonymous credentials, 12% cite attribute-based encryption. Field risks reinventing paradigms without engaging 40 years of prior work.

  > **BRIEF**: Identifies five identity mental models (space-time, presentation, attribute, relationship, capability) and their intersections for SSI architecture.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Andrieu et al. identify five mental models causing identity discourse miscommunication: space-time (physical continuity), presentation (subject's self-determination—SSI foundation), attribute (data correlation—ISO/IEC 24760-1), relationship (Ubuntu "I am because we are"), capability (pragmatic ability—Bitcoin example). Paper analyzes intersections: presentation + relationship produces verifiable credentials architecture.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: SSI community accepted relational identity as foundational model (presentation + relationship = verifiable credentials), yet implementations overwhelmingly built for presentation alone. The technical substrate for community credentials remains unbuilt.

  > **BRIEF**: Survey of 153 blockchain identity articles establishing five essential components framework for evaluating BC-IDMS solutions.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Ahmed et al. survey blockchain-based identity management analyzing 153 research articles and 11 commercial SSI platforms. Establishes normative framework based on five essential components (authentication, integrity, privacy, trust, simplicity) to systematically evaluate academic solutions across five domains (cloud computing, IoT, WSN, healthcare, generic identity) plus commercial offerings. Identifies critical weaknesses: privacy-transparency tensions, simplicity deficits, interoperability gaps. Finds no current solution adequately addresses all five components (privacy/simplicity weakest at 25-44% adequate).

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Demonstrates gap between SSI principles and implementation reality—no solution achieves all five essential components. Privacy and simplicity consistently weakest (25-44%), revealing operationalization challenges.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Documents fundamental privacy-transparency paradox: blockchain's core value (transparency, immutability) conflicts with identity's core requirement (privacy, selective disclosure). All solutions use workarounds.

Key properties: no single party can sign unilaterally (prevents abuse), losing up to N-K parties doesn't prevent signing (resilience), signature appears identical to single-party signature (privacy), threshold can adjust over time (graduated authority).

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Technical Delegation Lens)_: Modern threshold signature schemes enabling distributed authority where K-of-N parties must cooperate—cryptographic foundation for preventing single points of failure and abuse in guardianship, custodianship, and role separation.

  > **BRIEF**: Exposes how technologies reproduce racial inequity while appearing neutral, introducing "New Jim Code" concept for discriminatory automation.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Benjamin introduces the "New Jim Code"—new technologies that reflect and reproduce existing inequities while promoted as objective and progressive. Through examples ranging from gang databases 87% Black and Latinx to beauty contests judged by robots selecting only white winners, she demonstrates how automation hides, speeds, and deepens discrimination while appearing neutral.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: "Being excluded from the registry is tantamount to being denied existence." Documents how systems treating measurement as validation enable exclusion—colonial registries, Jim Crow tests, apartheid passes, contemporary algorithmic exclusion.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Shows how identity systems encode social hierarchies into technical architecture, creating structural coercion for marginalized communities. "Coded inequity" appears neutral while perpetuating injustice.

  > **BRIEF**: Framework showing algorithms structure networks via institutional arrangements, enabling network-based discrimination through data infrastructure control beyond categorical protections.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: boyd applies Castells' network theory of power to algorithmic systems, demonstrating algorithms both reflect and produce power through network-making work. Shows machine learning can discriminate based on network position rather than protected categories, creating legal blind spots. Argues data are socially produced, not neutral, making algorithms shift manipulation from models to data infrastructure. Positions algorithmic power as inseparable from political-economic contexts.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: "Algorithms do not make a system more neutral; they simply reconfigure the site of manipulation." Documents how algorithms enable network-based discrimination evading categorical antidiscrimination law—SSI systems must address network position alongside data control.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Birhane contrasts Ubuntu philosophy ("a person is a person through other persons") with Cartesian individualism ("I think therefore I am") embedded throughout Western psychology. Bakhtin's dialogical philosophy and emerging embodied/enactive cognition approaches offer relational alternatives recognizing selfhood as co-constructed through social interaction.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: Challenges assumption that identity is primarily individual property. If personhood is fundamentally relational ("I am because we are"), SSI systems must support relational identity.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Individualist assumptions hardcoded into SSI architecture exclude relational identity models dominant in non-Western cultures. SSI systems cannot see or support the bonds through which people actually live.

Examines theoretical foundations in time-inconsistent preferences, reviews empirical evidence from savings programs to health interventions, and analyzes design considerations. Shows commitment devices work when designed with appropriate stakes and flexibility.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Binding Commitments Lens)_: Comprehensive empirical evidence that voluntary constraint mechanisms work—people achieve better outcomes when they can bind their future selves.

Four limitation categories: circumvention (VPN bypasses), censorship (infrastructure repurposing), privacy (metadata tracking continues), centralization (complex libraries become "black boxes" determining functionality). Questions whether "win-win" solutions exist.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Challenges privacy-optimistic PET narratives—complex implementations become "black boxes" determining what can be proven and how, centralizing power among sophisticated vendors.

The study reveals an early-stage field: validation research dominates while evaluation research is nearly absent, usability receives zero attention, and two-thirds of implementations achieve genuine self-sovereignty while one-third implements decentralization without user control. Exponential publication growth and architecture proliferation without convergence indicate rapid expansion preceding empirical consolidation.

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational work on rational self-binding—Ulysses constraining future self enables otherwise impossible outcomes.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Elster analyzes precommitment strategies—how rational agents bind themselves against future weakness of will, as Ulysses bound himself before the Sirens. Key insight: humans uniquely relate strategically to their future selves, using constraints to achieve goals their unconstrained future selves would abandon.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Binding Commitments Lens)_: Foundational theory for Ulysses contracts—autonomy includes not just freedom of choice but freedom to constrain one's own future choices.

  > **BRIEF**: Systematic framework analyzing digital coercion through four dimensions across commercial and open-source platforms, proposing multi-layered standards as accountability.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Ehmke develops framework for digital coercion through four dimensions: attention (excessive time/cognitive demands), ergonomic (autonomy/usability tradeoffs), trust (unaccountable assumptions), cultural (Western norm imposition). Commercial platforms use dark patterns and surveillance capitalism; open platforms replicate coercion through maintenance burdens, accessibility neglect, and geographic concentration. Proposes standards across regulatory, technical, normative, ethical layers as accountability technology.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Four-dimensional framework identifying attention, ergonomic, trust, and cultural coercion—provides systematic vocabulary for auditing SSI designs for coercive patterns.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Documents how dark patterns, engagement manipulation, and ergonomic paywalls create structural coercion—same mechanisms SSI wallets must avoid replicating.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Self-Coercion Lens)_: "Without accountability, there can be no trust. Without trust, there can be no consent."—connects platform design to internalized compliance patterns.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Eubanks examines how automated systems in social services create a "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans. Through case studies of Indiana's automated welfare eligibility, Los Angeles' homeless services triage, and Allegheny County's child welfare risk scoring, she shows high-tech tools intensify historical patterns of discrimination.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Through Design Science Research, this paper develops "RefugeeID"—an SSI-based digital identity system for Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland. Three design iterations with 14 refugees and 4 experts reveal that gradual identification (issuing low-assurance credentials early) matters more than comprehensive features. The study derives seven design principles for crisis identity systems within a Government as a Platform framework.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Stewardship Lens)_: Reveals gap between "control" rhetoric and lived refugee experience—practical benefits (time savings, convenience) drove empowerment more than abstract sovereignty. Proposes "gradual identification" pattern: issue low-assurance credentials immediately at borders, progressively add verification.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Grigg argues that identity is an outcome of community, not captured state. Through rigorous analysis of identity theory, trust mechanics, Dunbar's number, and real-world validation via Kenyan chamas (savings groups), he demonstrates that peer-based identity in small trusted groups (10-30 people) with mutual financial stakes is the only model that hasn't failed.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Essential evidence that community credentials work at scale—200,000+ Kenyan chamas controlling $1.7B validate community-based trustworthiness assessment without institutional gatekeeping.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Foundational survey establishing four essential technical components required for SSI—provides architectural framework for evaluating implementation completeness.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Demonstrates how Zooko's Triangle was "squared" by blockchain, enabling identifiers that are simultaneously secure, decentralized, and human-readable—a paradigm shift in what was considered possible.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Naik and Jenkins propose 20 governing principles for evaluating Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystems, extending Christopher Allen's foundational 10 principles to address blockchain-enabled implementations. The framework covers sovereignty, data control, longevity, decentralization, verifiability, recovery, security, privacy, accessibility, and sustainability. Authors apply these principles to comparative analysis of uPort (Ethereum-based) and Sovrin (Hyperledger Indy-based) SSI ecosystems, revealing that while both satisfy core technical requirements, critical operational principles (portability, interoperability, scalability) remain unfulfilled.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: First comprehensive expansion of Allen's 10 principles to 20 covering technical, operational, and social dimensions. Provides evaluation framework revealing three-tier satisfaction pattern in implementations.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Analysis reveals SSI's fundamental challenge: technical cryptographic capabilities proven, but ecosystem infrastructure for global-scale deployment remains immature.

  > **BRIEF**: Critical assessment revealing SSI sovereignty as inherently contextual and jurisdiction-dependent rather than binary or absolute.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Naik and Jenkins critically examine whether self-sovereign identity systems truly provide sovereignty, analyzing sovereignty as contextual and multi-layered rather than binary. The paper distinguishes technological sovereignty (user control within SSI networks) from cyberspace sovereignty (state authority over physical infrastructure) and state sovereignty (legal jurisdiction over identity owners). Analysis reveals SSI provides genuine advances but cannot override jurisdictional constraints—identical SSI technology provides different sovereignty levels depending on local laws.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Critical assessment showing sovereignty as contextual and jurisdiction-dependent. Same SSI technology provides different sovereignty levels in different jurisdictions—essential for realistic SSI deployment.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: Demonstrates regulations can enhance sovereignty (GDPR aligns with SSI) or restrict it (states may prohibit SSI networks). Strategic implication: prioritize sovereignty-friendly jurisdictions for early adoption.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Nottingham examines architectural risks of proposed age restriction systems for Internet content. Identifies five key concerns: centralization (single-party verification creates honeypots and outages), privacy/security (exposure of sensitive attributes enables tracking), barriers to access (hardware/credential requirements disenfranchise users), fragmentation (incompatible jurisdictional systems), and age-gated Internet risks (creating "papers please" infrastructure). Proposes requirements for Internet-scale deployment.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: IETF standards document applying Internet architecture principles (decentralization, permissionless innovation) to evaluate age verification—model for assessing all identity regulations.

  > **BRIEF**: Examines failed large-scale state interventions, identifying how "legibility" requirements destroy local knowledge and contextual complexity.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Scott examines failed large-scale state interventions—from Soviet collectivization to Tanzanian villagization to modernist city planning—identifying four conditions common to planning disasters.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Context Boundaries Lens)_: Scott's "legibility" concept explains why context collapse harms individuals: states and platforms simplify complex contextual information into standardized categories.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Scott's framework reveals how identity systems become coercive infrastructure. "Legibility" projects—standardizing messy human identities—enable state control.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Self-Coercion Lens)_: Self-coercion is the internalized response to legibility: people anticipate what systems will see and modify behavior preemptively.

  > **BRIEF**: Proposes "generative identity" moving beyond self-sovereignty's individual focus to embrace emergent, relational, and contextual identity.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Sheldrake proposes generative identity as alternative to self-sovereign identity, arguing SSI's foundational principles encode logical contradictions undermining its liberatory goals. Introduces five principles—change, co-constitution, omni-directionality, friction, and non-universality.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: Challenges whether "sovereignty" adequately captures identity's nature. If identity is generative and relational rather than property-like, the "irreducible person" may be the relational nexus.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Co-constitution principle grounds bilateral consent: statement "X is friends with Y" cannot be owned by either party because it constitutes both identities simultaneously.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Zwitter et al. examine digital identity through philosophical, legal, and technical lenses, arguing SSI represents fundamental shift from purpose-driven identification toward infrastructural resource. Position digital identity within tensions between naturalist (uniquely individual) and constructivist (relationally constituted) worldviews. Through case studies (Estonia's e-ID, Forus platform, Kiva), demonstrate blockchain identity opportunities and risks. Warn against "Googlization" and neo-feudalism risks—meaningful self-sovereignty requires governance decisions addressing privacy, backup mechanisms, and power balances.
