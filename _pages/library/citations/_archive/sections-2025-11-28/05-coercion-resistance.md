### Eubanks (2018) Automating Inequality

* _**Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor**_ (2018). [book]. _Eubanks, Virginia._ St. Martin's Press, New York. ISBN: 978-1250074317. 260 pages. Author's website: <https://virginia-eubanks.com/automating-inequality/>. Publisher: <https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250074317/automatinginequality/>.

  > **TAGS**: #AutomatingInequality #AlgorithmicBias #DigitalPoorhouse #WelfareSurveillance #EubanksVirginia #SocialServices #Discrimination #PredictiveAnalytics #Poverty

  > **BRIEF**: Examines how automated systems create "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans through case studies of welfare, homeless services, and child welfare.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Eubanks examines how automated systems in social services create a "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans. Through case studies of Indiana's automated welfare eligibility, Los Angeles' homeless services triage, and Allegheny County's child welfare risk scoring, she shows high-tech tools intensify historical patterns of discrimination through speed, scale, and an appearance of objectivity.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Demonstrates structural coercion operating through welfare eligibility systems, homeless services triage, child welfare risk scoring—intensifying historical discrimination through speed, scale, and appearance of objectivity. The "digital poorhouse" creates coercion by limiting access to essential resources.

### Benjamin (2019) Race After Technology

* _**Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code**_ (2019). [book]. _Benjamin, Ruha._ Polity Press. ISBN: 978-1509526406. Available from author: <https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology>. Publisher: <https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Race+After+Technology:+Abolitionist+Tools+for+the+New+Jim+Code-p-9781509526437>.

  > **TAGS**: #AlgorithmicBias #RacialJustice #Technology #Discrimination #NewJimCode #Surveillance #ArtificialIntelligence #SocialJustice #BenjaminRuha #CriticalRaceStudies #TechEthics

  > **BRIEF**: Exposes how technologies reproduce racial inequity while appearing neutral, introducing "New Jim Code" concept for discriminatory automation.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Benjamin introduces the "New Jim Code"—new technologies that reflect and reproduce existing inequities while promoted as objective and progressive. Through examples ranging from gang databases 87% Black and Latinx to beauty contests judged by robots selecting only white winners, she demonstrates how automation hides, speeds, and deepens discrimination while appearing neutral. Because technology is human-created and learns from biased data, none is free from human prejudice.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Shows how identity systems encode social hierarchies into technical architecture, creating structural coercion for marginalized communities. "Coded inequity" appears neutral while perpetuating injustice—technology embeds and amplifies racial discrimination.

### Farahany (2023) Battle for Your Brain

* _**The Battle for Your Brain: Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology**_ (2023). [book]. _Farahany, Nita A._ St. Martin's Press. ISBN: 978-1250272966. Available from author: <https://www.nitafarahany.com/the-battle-for-your-brain>. Publisher: <https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250272966/thebattleforyourbrain/>.

  > **TAGS**: #CognitiveLiberty #Neurotechnology #MentalPrivacy #FreedomOfThought #FarahanyNita #BrainPrivacy #Neurorights #Autonomy #HumanRights

  > **BRIEF**: Argues neurotechnology advances require updating fundamental rights to protect cognitive liberty—mental privacy, self-determination, and freedom of thought.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Farahany argues that advances in neurotechnology enabling brain tracking and modification require updating fundamental rights to protect cognitive liberty—comprising mental privacy, self-determination, and freedom of thought. The first half examines how individuals, corporations, and governments now track and decode brain activity; the second half addresses brain modification including enhancement, manipulation, and assault. She proposes cognitive liberty as the single essential neuroright.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Critical for the cognitive coercion dimension—surveillance of thoughts, attention, emotional states without consent. Cognitive liberty (mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity, self-determination) represents the frontier of coercion resistance.

### Zuboff (2019) Surveillance Capitalism

* _**The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power**_ (2019). [book]. _Zuboff, Shoshana._ PublicAffairs, New York. 704 pages. ISBN 978-1-61039-569-4. Available from: <https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/>.

  > **TAGS**: #SurveillanceCapitalism #Privacy #BehavioralData #BigTech #ZuboffShoshana #DataExtraction #DigitalEconomy #Democracy #HumanAutonomy

  > **BRIEF**: Develops surveillance capitalism framework—unprecedented economic logic extracting behavioral surplus and deploying instrumentarian power through ubiquitous computation.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Zuboff develops surveillance capitalism framework identifying unprecedented economic logic that claims human experience as free raw material, extracts "behavioral surplus" beyond service improvement, manufactures prediction products sold in behavioral futures markets, and deploys "instrumentarian power" through ubiquitous computational architecture to modify behavior. Argues surveillance capitalism constitutes existential threat to democracy and human autonomy, calling for "synthetic declarations" that change the game rather than merely resist within it.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Essential theoretical foundation for inference coercion—"instrumentarian power" operates through behavioral prediction and modification, creating conformity pressure through automated systems. Provides framework for understanding how profiling creates coercion even without explicit commands.

### Scott (1998) Seeing Like a State *(draft)*

* _**Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed**_ (1998). [book]. _Scott, James C._ Yale University Press. ISBN: 9780300078152. 464 pages.

  > **TAGS**: #Legibility #StateSimplification #HighModernism #Metis #LocalKnowledge #ScottJamesC #PlanningFailures #CentralizedControl #Authoritarianism

  > **BRIEF**: Examines failed large-scale state interventions, identifying how "legibility" requirements destroy local knowledge and contextual complexity.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Scott examines failed large-scale state interventions—from Soviet collectivization to Tanzanian villagization to modernist city planning—identifying four conditions common to planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society, high-modernist ideology confident in scientific progress, willingness to use authoritarian power, and incapacitated civil society. He argues for the essential value of "metis" (practical local knowledge) that centralized schemes systematically destroy.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Scott's framework reveals how identity systems become coercive infrastructure. "Legibility" projects—standardizing messy human identities into machine-readable formats—enable state control. The four conditions he identifies (administrative ordering, high-modernist ideology, authoritarian power, weakened civil society) describe precisely the risks of centralized digital ID systems that SSI aims to avoid.
