Working Circles are the vehicle for the early-phase work of #RevisitingSSI. Their Lens Exploration Briefs will help us map the problem space, build shared understanding, and seed the deeper work ahead.

A **Working Circle** is a small, self-organized group focused on a shared lens, theme, or concern. Its purpose is to explore, not to advocate, finalize, or specify.

Working Circles help us surface areas where the SSI ecosystem has become fragmented, misunderstood, or misaligned with its foundational goals, offering space to collaboratively clarify, refine, or redirect these trajectories at a principle level.

Working Circles should aim to be:

- **Interdisciplinary and inclusive**
- **Constructive and curious**
- **High-level and strategic**, not technical
- **Grounded in references or lived experience**

## Working Circle Composition

Effective Working Circles typically include 3-7 members bringing diverse perspectives. We encourage circles to include participants from different:
- Disciplines (technical, policy, advocacy, academic, etc.)
- Organizational backgrounds (to avoid groupthink)
- Geographic or cultural contexts (when possible)

Circles with 2 or fewer members may struggle with perspective diversity; circles with 8+ may benefit from splitting into focused sub-groups. The goal is rich dialogue without unwieldy coordination.

## Forming and Joining Working Circles

At the [December 2nd kickoff meetings](#phase-1-kickoff-meetings), we will:
1. **Surface initial topics and lenses** through open discussion
2. **Self-organize into circles** based on shared interests
3. **Exchange contact information** for coordination
4. **Establish meeting schedules** within each circle

Late joiners can connect with existing circles through the Signal group or propose new circles if they identify uncovered territory.

Each Circle will produce a short [**Lens Exploration Brief**](/lenses/briefs/) (1–3 pages) that:

- Defines a meaningful territory or lens
- Suggests **strategic, high-level directions or requirements**
- Helps other participants understand and engage with the topic
- Provides insight into how this lens may inform the 2026 SSI Principles
  - and/or surfaces potential strategic solutions to societal harms, risks, or tensions of digital identity systems
- Identifies open questions the Circle is working through
- Poses questions that require dialogue beyond the Working Circle

## From Briefs to Papers

[Lens Exploration Briefs](/lenses/briefs/) are designed as initial scoping documents. Working Circles may choose to develop their briefs into full papers for broader publication. This requires:

- Limiting scope to what's achievable with available time
- Assigning specific sections or tasks to members
- Setting internal deadlines for drafts and revisions
- Maintaining momentum through regular check-ins
- Communicating openly about availability and capacity

Not all briefs will become full papers, and that's expected. A well-scoped brief that clearly articulates a lens and its implications is valuable even if not developed further. Incomplete work can inform future efforts or seed other projects. Those circles that do pursue full papers typically designate a lead author to coordinate final editing and publication after collaborative drafting is complete.
