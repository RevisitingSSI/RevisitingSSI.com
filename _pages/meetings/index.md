## Future Meetings

All-hands meetings are expected to be:

- **Frequency**: Monthly (last week of the month)
- **Format**: Working sessions focused on cross-Circle dialogue, feedback on emerging briefs, and collaborative problem-solving
- **Duration**: 90 minutes

Final dates and Zoom links will be shared through Signal and email channels.

Community meetings will use Zoom with accessibility features available on request. **Transcripts and video recordings** will be provided within a few days after each meeting for those who cannot attend synchronously or need to review discussions.
