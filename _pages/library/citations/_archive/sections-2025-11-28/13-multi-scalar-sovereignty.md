  > **BRIEF**: Analyzes how Microsoft, Amazon, and Google redefined digital sovereignty from political capacity to commercial product—warning pattern for SSI.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Grohmann and Costa Barbosa analyze how Microsoft, Amazon, and Google strategically redefined digital sovereignty (2022-2023) through cloud programs responding to European regulatory pressure. Critical discourse analysis reveals convergent transformation: sovereignty shifts from political capacity (collective self-determination, state control) to commercial product (modular services purchased through proprietary platforms). Fundamental power inversion—platforms provision sovereignty on their terms rather than being subject to sovereign authority, naturalizing dependency while maintaining sovereignty rhetoric.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Big Tech presents sovereignty as "a journey" leading to their own services—a pattern SSI faces directly. If Microsoft ION, Google/Amazon identity services, or dominant wallet providers capture SSI implementations, "self-sovereign identity" becomes consumer service provisioned on platform terms, not political capacity users inherently possess.

### Dyer-Witheford (2015) Cyber-Proletariat

* _**Cyber-Proletariat: Global Labour in the Digital Vortex**_ (2015). [book]. _Dyer-Witheford, Nick._ Pluto Press. Digital Barricades series. ISBN: 978-0745334035. Available at: <https://archive.org/details/cyberproletariat0000dyer>.

  > **TAGS**: #CyberProletariat #DigitalLabor #PlatformCapitalism #GlobalLabor #DyerWithefordNick #DigitalEconomy #LaborExploitation #TechCritique

  > **BRIEF**: Examines digital capitalism's creation of feudal dependencies masquerading as autonomy—platforms deepen subordination through service dependency.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Dyer-Witheford examines digital capitalism's dark side: coltan mines in Congo, electronics factories in China, devastated neighborhoods in Detroit. Using Marx's vortex metaphor, he shows how the digital revolution enables capital to eject powerful workers while recruiting global sources of cheapened labour. He analyzes migrant assembly-line proletariat, free online labor fueling Web 2.0 profits, and high-speed trading's AI dependency, while examining information technology's potential within radical movements.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Platform capitalism creates feudal dependencies masquerading as autonomy—"digital sovereignty" claimed by platforms actually deepens subordination through service dependency. This lens warns SSI against platforms seeking a sovereignty seat without accepting reciprocal obligations characteristic of peer sovereigns.

### Hui (2016) Question Concerning Technology in China

* _**The Question Concerning Technology in China: An Essay in Cosmotechnics**_ (2016). [book]. _Hui, Yuk._ Urbanomic. ISBN: 978-0995455009. Publisher: <https://www.urbanomic.com/book/question-concerning-technology-china/>. Also: <https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780995455009/the-question-concerning-technology-in-china/>.

  > **BRIEF**: Argues sovereignty isn't universal but culturally situated—global SSI must negotiate across traditions rather than imposing single Western model.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Hui responds to Heidegger's "Question Concerning Technology" by arguing Western technē—tool for mastering nature—differs fundamentally from Chinese Dao-Qi, where technology harmonizes cosmic and ethical principles. He introduces "cosmotechnics": the unification of cosmic and moral order through technical activities. Rather than accepting technological universalism, Hui argues for reconstructing Chinese technological thought capable of navigating modernity without mere westernization.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Sovereignty isn't a universal concept but culturally situated—Chinese "technological sovereignty" differs from European "digital sovereignty" in philosophical grounding and goals. Global SSI implementations must negotiate across traditions (Dao-Qi, Ubuntu, Indigenous sovereignty) rather than imposing a single Western model of self-determination.

* _**What does the notion of "sovereignty" mean when referring to the digital?**_ (2019). [paper]. _Couture, Stéphane; Toupin, Sophie._ New Media & Society, Vol. 21, No. 10, pp. 2305-2322. DOI: 10.1177/1461444819865984.

  > **BRIEF**: Maps terrain of "digital sovereignty" meanings—state sovereignty vs. community autonomy vs. data sovereignty require different architectures.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: This article examines how the notion of "sovereignty" is used to describe various forms of independence, control, and autonomy over digital infrastructures, technologies, and data. Drawing from research with activist tech collectives, the authors show that while sovereignty generally asserts collective control over digital content or infrastructure, precise interpretations differ significantly—from governmental policy perspectives emphasizing state control to grassroots movements emphasizing community autonomy.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Maps the terrain SSI principles must navigate—"digital sovereignty" means radically different things to different actors. State sovereignty emphasizes territorial control; technological sovereignty emphasizes community self-sufficiency; data sovereignty emphasizes jurisdictional authority. SSI's "self-sovereign" identity must clarify which sovereignty tradition it draws from and how it relates to competing claims.

  > **TAGS**: #CAREPrinciples #IndigenousDataSovereignty #DataGovernance #CollectiveBenefit #AuthorityToControl #IndigenousRights #FAIRPrinciples #CommunityGovernance

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates individual-focused SSI frameworks miss collective sovereignty traditions—Indigenous data sovereignty requires community governance, not just individual control.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Developed by the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group within the Research Data Alliance, the CARE Principles provide an Indigenous-centered framework complementing data-centric FAIR standards. The four pillars ensure data ecosystems serve Indigenous nations (Collective Benefit), affirm Indigenous governance rights (Authority to Control), emphasize respectful relationships and capacity building (Responsibility), and prioritize Indigenous representation in assessing benefits and harms (Ethics).

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: CARE Principles demonstrate that individual-focused SSI frameworks miss collective sovereignty traditions. Indigenous data sovereignty isn't about individual control but community governance of collective heritage. SSI principles must accommodate collective identity and governance, not just individual self-sovereignty—a critical gap in current frameworks.

### Pohle & Santaniello (2024) Digital Sovereignty Discourse *(draft)*

* _**From Multistakeholderism to Digital Sovereignty: Toward a New Discursive Order in Internet Governance?**_ (2024). [paper]. _Pohle, Julia; Santaniello, Mauro._ Policy & Internet, Vol. 16, No. 4, pp. 672-691. DOI: 10.1002/poi3.426.

  > **TAGS**: #Multistakeholderism #DigitalSovereignty #InternetGovernance #SnowdenRevelations #RegulatoryShift #GovernanceModels #DigitalPolicy #InternationalRelations

  > **BRIEF**: Documents tension between multistakeholder governance and digital sovereignty—SSI must navigate between platform capture and state control.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Since the early 2000s, multistakeholder governance has been the reference model for transnational internet governance. However, many countries—including democracies—have adopted measures strengthening digital sovereignty that are often at odds with multistakeholderism. Using the discourse coalition framework, the authors show that post-2013 Snowden revelations catalyzed this shift. Countries like the EU and Brazil may support multistakeholder DNS management while simultaneously institutionalizing digital sovereignty discourse elsewhere.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Multi-Scalar Sovereignty Lens)_: Documents the tension SSI faces: multistakeholder governance promises inclusive participation but enables platform capture; digital sovereignty promises autonomy but enables state control. SSI must navigate between these poles—neither pure multistakeholderism (captured by incumbents) nor pure sovereignty (captured by states) serves individual agency.
