## Overview 

The main topics were:

### **Context**: The ten-year question

It's been ten years since ["The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity"](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/) and its [ten principles](https://revisitingssi.com/library/ssi-principles/). They've been widely accepted. But things have also [gone wrong](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/ssi-bankruptcy/). 

How can we redefine the principles of self-sovereign identity to actually reduce centralized power, as was our original intent?

### **Lenses**: 15 ways of seeing

In reviewing critiques of the original principles, we've decided that no viewpoint is complete. So instead we offer up 15 "lenses", each intended to look at the issue of self-sovereign identity in differnet ways.

#### Category 1: Foundational Principles & Rights

What makes identity a _**right**_ rather than a privilege?
    
1. **Irreducible Person** — Existence before encoding
2. **Anti-Property** — Identity cannot be owned or sold
3. **Right to Transact** — Digital participation as constitutional right
4. **Cryptographic Paradigms** — Assumptions that shape possibility

#### Category 2: Preventing Coercion

How do systems compel behavior and how do we resist?
    
1. **Coercion Resistance** — Privacy defends against force
2. **Self-Coercion** — When control feels like your own idea
3. **Choice Architecture** — Small choices become structural traps
4. **Binding Commitments** — When constraint enables trust

#### Category 3: Relational & Contextual Identity

Identity exists in relationship: to others, to context, to scale.
    
1. **Relational Autonomy** — “I am because we are”
2. **Context Boundaries** — Keeping life spheres distinct
3. **Multi-Scalar Sovereignty** — Individual, community, nation
4. **Stewardship** — Caring for those who cannot consent

#### Category 4: Compliance, Governance & Technical

How do our principles survive contact with law, standards, and power?
    
1. **Principles to Compliance** — Not everything can be measured
2. **Regulatory Frameworks** — Voluntary erodes to mandatory
3. **Principal Authority** — Restoring accountability to agents

### **Working Circles**: What they produce

Revisiting SSI is organizing [working circles](/circles/), with the intent of producing policy papers, in the style of Christopher's [Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops](https://www.weboftrust.info/).

### **Activity**: Breakouts and discussion

The Kickoff Meeting was a working meeting, with the main activity focused on helping people to discover their interests among the lenses and self-organize into groups around them.

### **Next Steps**: Two kickoffs, one community

A follow-up meeting will occur on December 9, at a time more friendly to Asia.

## Key Quotes

Four topics generated sufficient interest for short lens breakout groups: Relational Autonomy, the Irreducible Person, Regulatory Frameworks, and Coercion. The following are drawn from group reports after the break-outs:

### Relational Autonomy

> "Technical systems accelerate a trend toward alienation, undermining the various layers of social belonging, both as internally perceived by those participants, as well as mutually held outside of formal institutional or codified structures. So if we're not keeping that stuff in mind, it may be further eroded."

### The Irreducible Person

> "The harm is that we may end up building systems where people are not properly and universally recognized as a person, right? And that is a fundamental human rights problem if potentially there's a way how people may be denied their humanity, their personhood."

>  "In human history, we've often seen atrocities and genocide and whatever as a consequence of dehumanization. So that's a potential harm, again, if the participants in a system are not universally given this recognition as a person."

### Regulatory Frameworks

> "One of the risks of writing this is that 10 years from now, it could look silly because it could be proven totally wrong if it gives concrete suggestions that get taken up and Google and Apple still do an end run around it."

> "If you get to the point of concrete suggestions, then you're just giving Google and Apple a head start."

### Coercion

> "Simply by acting online, the observations drawn and the conclusions that can be drawn lead us down that path [of coercion], especially when you have platforms controlling things."

> "When you share things online, how can you prevent that from being leveraged for those purposes?"
