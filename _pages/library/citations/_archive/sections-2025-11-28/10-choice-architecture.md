## Choice Architecture & Exit Rights Lens

### Wu (2018) Tyranny of Convenience

* _**The Tyranny of Convenience**_ (2018). [article]. _Wu, Tim._ The New York Times, February 16, 2018. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html>.

  > **TAGS**: #Convenience #LockIn #PlatformMonopoly #WuTim #SwitchingCosts #DigitalDependency #NetworkEffects #ConsumerBehavior

  > **BRIEF**: Documents how convenience creates lock-in transforming voluntary choice into permanent dependency—frictionless efficiency breeds monopoly.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Wu argues convenience is "the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today." Created to free us, convenience has a dark side—it threatens to erase struggles that give life meaning and can become a constraint enslaving us. Tracing two waves of convenience (labor-saving technology, then personalized digital services), Wu demonstrates how frictionless efficiency breeds monopoly: "The easier it is to use Amazon, the more powerful Amazon becomes."

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Documents how convenience creates lock-in transforming initial voluntary choice into permanent dependency. Switching costs make exit prohibitively expensive despite nominal freedom to leave. Frictionless efficiency breeds monopoly—the structural coercion pattern where accumulated dependencies eliminate alternatives.

### Eubanks (2018) Automating Inequality

  > **BRIEF**: Examines how automated systems create "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans through case studies of welfare, homeless services, and child welfare.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Eubanks examines how automated systems in social services create a "digital poorhouse" that profiles and punishes poor Americans. Through case studies of Indiana's automated welfare eligibility, Los Angeles' homeless services triage, and Allegheny County's child welfare risk scoring, she shows high-tech tools intensify historical patterns of discrimination through speed, scale, and an appearance of objectivity.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Documents credential dependency chains where "voluntary" biometric enrollment conceals structural coercion when the alternative is starvation. Cascading requirements create lock-in: can't get benefits without biometric, can't get biometric without ID, can't get ID without address. Each step appears "voluntary" but the chain eliminates alternatives.

  > **TAGS**: #PrivacyConsent #InformedConsent #PrivacySelfManagement #SoloveDaniel #ConsentDilemma #InformationAsymmetry #PrivacyLaw #UserRights

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates privacy consent mechanisms fail—assumptions of informed, empowered users false given information asymmetry and manufactured consent.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Solove critiques the dominant "privacy self-management" regulatory approach where consent legitimizes data collection and use. Drawing on empirical and social science research, he demonstrates key assumptions about individual decision-making are false—people cannot meaningfully manage their privacy. Yet the apparent solution (paternalism) denies freedom. Solove proposes focusing on downstream data uses, developing coherent consent approaches, and creating substantive privacy rules.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Demonstrates privacy consent mechanisms fail—assumptions of informed, empowered users false given information asymmetry, power imbalance, and manufactured consent. Provides evidence that "nutrition labels" for identity decisions could enable genuine choice rather than consent theater by making consequences visible and comparable.

### Allen (2021) Principal Authority

* _**Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2021). [article]. _Allen, Christopher (with Shannon Appelcline)._ Life With Alacrity [blog], September 15, 2021. Retrieved 2025-11-20 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/principal-authority/>.

  > **TAGS**: #PrincipalAuthority #AgencyLaw #SSI #Wyoming #SF0039 #AllenChristopher #DigitalIdentity #LegalFramework #Delegation

  > **BRIEF**: Analyzes Wyoming's SF0039—first U.S. legal definition of digital identity using "principal authority" to import Agency law precedent, grounding revocability.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen analyzes Wyoming's SF0039—first U.S. legal definition of digital identity using "principal authority" to import Agency law precedent. Reframes 10 SSI principles as rights (existence, control, persistence, consent), identity duties (access, transparency, portability, interoperability, minimization, protection), and Agency duties (specificity, responsibility, representation, fidelity, disclosure). Grounds SSI in peer-to-peer relationships mediated by state rather than property law's state sovereignty.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Wyoming SF0039 grounds digital identity in Agency law where revocability is core principle—principals can withdraw delegation anytime. If revocation is impossible or prohibitively costly, "voluntary" delegation was coerced. Structural barriers preventing exit violate legal revocability duty.

### Scott (1998) Seeing Like a State *(draft)*

* _**Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed**_ (1998). [book]. _Scott, James C._ Yale University Press. ISBN: 9780300078152. 464 pages.

  > **TAGS**: #Legibility #StateSimplification #HighModernism #Metis #LocalKnowledge #ScottJamesC #PlanningFailures #CentralizedControl #Authoritarianism

  > **BRIEF**: Examines failed large-scale state interventions, identifying how "legibility" requirements destroy local knowledge and contextual complexity.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Scott examines failed large-scale state interventions—from Soviet collectivization to Tanzanian villagization to modernist city planning—identifying four conditions common to planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society, high-modernist ideology confident in scientific progress, willingness to use authoritarian power, and incapacitated civil society. He argues for the essential value of "metis" (practical local knowledge) that centralized schemes systematically destroy.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: State "legibility" projects—simplifying messy reality into standardized categories—parallel platform choice architecture that forces users into predetermined paths. Scott's insight that centralized schemes destroy local knowledge applies directly to identity systems: one-size-fits-all credential flows eliminate contextual nuance and user agency that SSI principles protect.
