## Timeline & Milestones

This initiative unfolds across multiple phases, culminating in publication of revised SSI principles for the **ten-year anniversary** of the original principles (April 26th, 2016):

**Phase 1 (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)**: Lens Exploration Briefs mapping the problem space and surfacing strategic directions

**Phase 2 (Feb - Mar 2026)**: Development of selected briefs into full papers; deeper research and cross-lens synthesis

**Phase 3 (Apr 2026)**: Drafting revised SSI principles informed by Phase 1-2 work; preparation for **April 28th, 2026 publication** (targeting CoinDesk and other venues)

**Ongoing (May - Dec 2026)**: Finalizing papers for peer review, conference presentations, and broader community engagement

Details about Phase 2 participation will be shared in late January based on Phase 1 outputs.

## Phase 1 Topics

In 2016, the original *Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)* provided a foundation for decentralized, privacy-respecting identity. A decade later, digital identity operates within a transformed landscape containing: AI inference, behavioral design, biometric systems, platform governance, global data markets, and widening social inequalities.

Meanwhile, SSI itself has grown in influence, but different interpretations and implementations have drifted in divergent directions. Some of these evolutions have advanced the original vision, while others raise new concerns or reflect misunderstandings of the foundational principles. Revisiting the principles now allows us to realign around shared values, to address gaps, and to anchor the next decade of SSI work in clear, human-centered commitments.

The primary goal of this initiative is to **revisit and refresh the SSI principles for 2026**, grounding them in contemporary sociotechnical realities.

At the same time, we welcome contributions that explore **high-level, strategic approaches for reducing the societal harms and risks created by digital identity systems**, whether SSI-based or not. These should remain conceptual, normative, and strategic (not specifications or protocol design).

**Outputs from these workshops are artifact-driven**: They may inform revised SSI principles, surface strategic solutions to identity harms, or both. Working Circles will develop these outputs into full papers and articles that provide guidance for policymakers, implementers, and advocates. Our goal is not conversation for its own sake, but concrete deliverables that influence how identity systems evolve.

## Open Outputs & Licensing

This initiative is committed to openness and accessibility. All materials produced, including Lens Exploration Briefs, working papers, final documents, and code contributions, are released under open licenses:

- **Written works** (papers, briefs, syntheses): [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- **Code contributions**: Appropriate open source licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

This ensures the work remains in the commons, accessible to researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and communities worldwide. It reflects our commitment to shared knowledge and collaborative advancement of SSI principles.

## Authorship & Attribution

Contributors to papers and briefs will be credited according to their level of participation, inspired by [AMA guidelines for determining authorship](https://www.google.com/books/edition/AMA_Manual_of_Style/Dy3JDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22All+authors+should+have+participated+sufficiently+in+the+work+to+take+public+responsibility%22&pg=PT205&printsec=frontcover) (see [Working Circles](#working-circles-purpose--expectations) for details on collaborative credit):

- **Authors**: Those who substantially contribute to conception, drafting, revision, and can take public responsibility for the work
- **Contributors**: Those who provide input, feedback, or support but at a lesser level of engagement

Working Circles determine authorship collectively, ensuring credit reflects actual contribution rather than organizational affiliation or seniority.
