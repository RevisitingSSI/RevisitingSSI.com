### Renieris (2023) Beyond Data

* _**Beyond Data: Reclaiming Human Rights at the Dawn of the Metaverse**_ (2023). [book]. _Renieris, Elizabeth M._ MIT Press. ISBN: 978-0262047821. Author: <https://hackylawyer.com/beyond-data-book>. Publisher: <https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047821/beyond-data/>.

  > **TAGS**: #DataRights #HumanRights #Privacy #Metaverse #RenierisElizabeth #DigitalIdentity #DataOwnership #TechEthics #SurveillanceCapitalism

  > **BRIEF**: Comprehensive critique of "data ownership" frameworks; calls for grounding digital identity in human rights rather than property law.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Renieris argues that fifty years of data-focused regulation—data protection, privacy, security, ownership—has failed to protect core human values including privacy itself. Data is contextual and dynamic, making it an unstable foundation for rights. As technologies alter shared reality and diminish democratic participation, she proposes shifting focus from data to effects on people, assessing technologies against broader rights including non-discrimination, human dignity, and self-determination.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Anti-Property Lens)_: Comprehensive critique of "data ownership" frameworks—property models extend surveillance capitalism's broken logic. Calls for grounding digital identity in human rights law (dignity, autonomy, non-discrimination) rather than property law (ownership, alienability, markets). "Data" discourse distracts from human rights violations by reducing people to information assets.

### Radin (1996) Contested Commodities

* _**Contested Commodities**_ (1996). [book]. _Radin, Margaret Jane._ Harvard University Press. ISBN: 978-0674007161. Publisher: <https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674007161>.

  > **TAGS**: #MarketInalienability #Commodification #Personhood #Property #RadinMargaret #LegalTheory #Dignity #Ethics #EconomicRights

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational market-inalienability theory—some things too bound up with personhood to commodify, including core identity attributes.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Radin asks why not sell everything—body parts, babies, sex? Her answer: universal commodification impairs human flourishing by compromising contexts needed for personhood. Poor people would sell what the wealthy find abhorrent, reflecting liberal democracy's tension between choice freedom and personhood protection. As a pragmatist, she proposes "incomplete commodification"—regulated exchange of contested goods under conditions protecting human dignity and flourishing.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Anti-Property Lens)_: Foundational market-inalienability theory—some things too bound up with personhood to commodify. Application to identity: biometric data, medical histories, political beliefs are constitutive of personhood and shouldn't be tradeable commodities, even if "voluntarily" sold.

### Harris (1993) Whiteness as Property

  > **TAGS**: #WhitenessAsProperty #CriticalRaceTheory #PropertyLaw #RacialJustice #HarrisCheryl #LegalHistory #SystemicRacism #StructuralInequality

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates how property law historically encoded racial hierarchies—whiteness functioned as property granting access, opportunity, protection.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Harris examines how whiteness evolved from racial identity into a form of property historically protected in American law. Following slavery and conquest, white racial identity became the basis for allocating societal benefits—a status property ratified by law. Even after legal segregation ended, whiteness as property continues as barrier to change. Harris argues affirmative action distortions can only be addressed by confronting the property interest in whiteness.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Anti-Property Lens)_: Property law historically encoded racial hierarchies—whiteness functioned as property granting access, opportunity, protection. Warning for digital identity: treating identity as property risks encoding similar exclusions through algorithmic systems using data to reproduce discrimination.

### Cohen (2019) Between Truth and Power

* _**Between Truth and Power: The Legal Constructions of Informational Capitalism**_ (2019). [book]. _Cohen, Julie E._ Oxford University Press. ISBN: 978-0190246693. Author: <https://juliecohen.com/between-truth-and-power/>. Publisher: <https://global.oup.com/academic/product/between-truth-and-power-9780190246693>.

  > **TAGS**: #InformationalCapitalism #LegalTheory #DataGovernance #PlatformPower #CohenJulie #TechLaw #InstitutionalChange #DataMarkets

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates how code and law co-construct identity as extractable capital; property frameworks actively create data as commodity.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Cohen examines how legal institutions are enlisted to produce the sociotechnical shifts accompanying informational capitalism, transforming fundamentally in the process. Datafication and platform intermediation have reshaped economic activity and information exchange. Platform authority—both practical and normative—has become taken-for-granted, reshaping law in its own image. The book draws on legal theory, STS, information studies, and organization studies to develop a theory of institutional change.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Anti-Property Lens)_: Demonstrates how code and law co-construct identity as extractable capital. Property frameworks don't just describe data—they actively create it as commodity. "Code" (technical architecture) and "law" (legal frameworks) have "fractal effects"—shaping what's possible, who benefits, how reality is understood.

### Purtova (2015) Illusion of Personal Data

* _**The Illusion of Personal Data as No One's Property**_ (2015). [paper]. _Purtova, Nadezhda._ Law, Innovation and Technology, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 83-111. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17579961.2015.1052646>. Also available at SSRN: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2346693>.

  > **TAGS**: #DataProperty #PropertyRights #DataProtection #LegalTheory #PurtovaNadezhda #DataOwnership #CorporateData #PropertyRegimes

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates "no one owns data" is illusion—corporations already claim quasi-property rights; individual ownership validates framework favoring institutional actors.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Purtova challenges the assumption that data protection regimes need not address property rights in personal data. Building on Umbeck's work, she demonstrates that without legislative property assignment, personal data will be appropriated in proportion to market participants' de facto power to exclude others. The paper reconceptualizes personal data as a rivalrous resource within an ecosystem, refuting core anti-propertization arguments and reframing the question as whose property rights should exist.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Anti-Property Lens)_: "No one owns data" is illusion—corporations already claim quasi-property rights through database rights, trade secrets, contractual assignments. Giving individuals "data ownership" validates property framework where corporations have structural advantages. Warning: property thinking itself is the problem, not who holds property rights.

### Nissenbaum (2009) Privacy in Context

* _**Privacy in Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life**_ (2009). [book]. _Nissenbaum, Helen._ Stanford Law Books, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. 304 pages. ISBN 978-0-8047-5236-7. Available from Stanford University Press: <https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8862>.

  > **TAGS**: #ContextualIntegrity #Privacy #InformationFlow #NissenbaumHelen #PrivacyTheory #SocialNorms #DataProtection #TechnologyPolicy #EthicsOfPrivacy

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational privacy theory—violations occur when information flows breach context-specific norms, not merely when individuals lose control.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Nissenbaum argues privacy violations occur when information flows breach context-specific norms, not when individuals lose control. Contextual integrity framework analyzes flows using five parameters (data subject, sender, recipient, information type, transmission principle) and nine-step decision heuristic. Rejects notice-and-consent paradigm; demonstrates privacy depends on social contexts (healthcare, education, commerce) having distinct purposes and governing norms.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Anti-Property Lens)_: Alternative to property-based privacy: information flows must match social context norms, not blanket ownership rules. Property thinking enables context collapse: "you own this data, license it anywhere." Contextual integrity requires information flows match norms, aggregation across contexts is limited, social roles carry specific obligations.
