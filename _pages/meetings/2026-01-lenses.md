The second Revisiting SSI meeting was held on **January 13** (for Americas, Africa, and Europe) and **January 14** (for Asia). Its intended focus was on "Forming Lenses". No working groups were definitively formed, but there were more introductions and more discussions of Self-Sovereign Identity.

## Key Points

Some of the key points from the two sessions included:

* There's **no definition** of "Self-sovereign identity" (SSI). That was intentional: when Christopher wrote ["The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity"](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/), the 10 principles were intended as an alternative. That's why revisiting and updating the principles for the 10th anniversary is so important.
* There's a **divide in talk about identity** between individual (Western) and group-focused (Ubuntu) designs. One participant suggested that SSI might be more similar to the Ubuntu design.
* **Anti-coercion** remains an important new lens for considering SSI.
* SSI should allow for multiple contextual identities and **identity experimentation**, something that's seen in large amount among younger users of the net.
* **Taiwan** is piloting digital wallets through  [MODA](https://moda.gov.tw/en/press/press-releases/18262); details are provided in the Asia/Europe meeting.
* **C2PA**, which verifies media sources, is another topic of interest to SSI; details are again provided in the Asia/Europe meeting.

## Key Quotes

**On the term self-sovereign identity:**
> "If it gets diluted and there's no strong boundary to point at, that term is going to get lost and that whole movement is going to get lost."

**On C2PA:**
> "If everybody's device that is able to document content... is now traceable back to the person who has that device and can't be safely elided in some fashion to protect the sources, I think that it can lead to very authoritarian type of practices."
