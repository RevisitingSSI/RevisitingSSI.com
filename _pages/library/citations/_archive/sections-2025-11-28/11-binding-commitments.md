### Grigg (2021) The Identity Cycle

  > **TAGS**: #IdentityCycle #Chamas #CommunityIdentity #TrustMechanics #GriggIan #PeerBasedIdentity #MutualObligations #SocialCapital #DunbarNumber

  > **BRIEF**: Demonstrates productive voluntary constraint through chamas—mutual obligations, clear benefits, exit rights, bounded scope create trust and cooperation.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Grigg argues that identity is an outcome of community, not captured state. Through rigorous analysis of identity theory, trust mechanics, Dunbar's number, and real-world validation via Kenyan chamas (savings groups), he demonstrates that peer-based identity in small trusted groups (10-30 people) with mutual financial stakes is the only model that hasn't failed. Provides devastating critique of state IDs, corporate data, PKI, and Web of Trust, then proposes group-forming networks with skin in the game as foundation for digital identity systems.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Binding Commitments Lens)_: Exemplifies productive voluntary constraint—chamas work through mutual obligations, clear benefits, exit rights, and bounded scope. People voluntarily join structures with mutual stakes when constraint becomes valuable rather than exploitative. Provides model for SSI commitment mechanisms: credible constraints enabling cooperation by binding individual opportunism.

### Elster (1979) Ulysses and the Sirens

* _**Ulysses and the Sirens: Studies in Rationality and Irrationality**_ (1979). [book]. _Elster, Jon._ Cambridge University Press. Revised edition 1984. ISBN: 978-0521269841. Available at: <https://archive.org/details/ulyssessirensstu0000elst>.

  > **TAGS**: #UlyssesContracts #Precommitment #Rationality #SelfBinding #ElsterJon #Akrasia #DecisionTheory #SelfControl #StrategicBehavior

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational theory for Ulysses contracts—autonomy includes freedom to constrain one's own future choices.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Elster analyzes precommitment strategies—how rational agents bind themselves against future weakness of will, as Ulysses bound himself before the Sirens. The book proceeds from perfect rationality through imperfect rationality (where binding overcomes myopic impulses) to problematic rationality (games without solutions). Key insight: humans uniquely relate strategically to their future selves, using constraints to achieve goals their unconstrained future selves would abandon.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Binding Commitments Lens)_: Foundational theory for Ulysses contracts—autonomy includes not just freedom of choice but freedom to constrain one's own future choices. Present-self constraining future-self enables rational long-term achievement despite predictable failures of will. Essential for SSI commitment mechanisms.

### Schelling (1960) Strategy of Conflict

* _**The Strategy of Conflict**_ (1960). [book]. _Schelling, Thomas C._ Harvard University Press. ISBN: 978-0674840317. Publisher: <https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674840317>.

  > **TAGS**: #GameTheory #CredibleCommitment #Negotiation #FocalPoints #SchellingThomas #StrategicBehavior #Deterrence #Cooperation #NobelPrize

  > **BRIEF**: Game theory classic showing commitment problems are central to cooperation—strategic self-limitation creates credibility enabling trust.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Schelling pioneered the application of game theory to real-world strategic behavior in negotiation, war, and deterrence. He introduced foundational concepts including "focal points" (naturally salient solutions in coordination) and "credible commitment" (binding oneself to strengthen negotiating position). Counter-intuitively, he showed that limiting one's own options can increase bargaining power, and uncertain retaliation is more credible than certain retaliation. Nobel Prize 2005.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Binding Commitments Lens)_: Game theory classic showing commitment problems are central to cooperation—without ability to bind yourself, others can't trust your promises. Strategic self-limitation creates credibility enabling trust and coordination impossible with pure flexibility. "Burning bridges" makes commitments believable.

### Bryan et al. (2010) Commitment Devices

  > **BRIEF**: Empirical evidence that people actively seek commitment mechanisms to constrain future-self—validates SSI commitment device design.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Bryan, Karlan, and Nelson review evidence on commitment devices—mechanisms people use to constrain future choices and overcome self-control problems. The paper distinguishes hard commitments (binding constraints) from soft commitments (psychological aids), examines conditions when commitment devices are demanded, and evaluates field evidence on their effectiveness. Policy implications include applications to sin taxes, consumer protection, and optimal commitment device design.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Binding Commitments Lens)_: Empirical evidence that people actively seek commitment mechanisms to constrain future-self when present-self recognizes future failures of will. Distinguishes hard vs. soft commitments with policy implications. Shows demand for self-binding mechanisms across domains—savings, exercise, smoking cessation—validating SSI commitment device design.
