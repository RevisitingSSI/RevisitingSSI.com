### Carter (2023) Operation Choke Point 2.0

* _**The Reality Behind the Crypto Banking Crackdown: 'Operation Choke Point 2.0' Is Here**_ (2023). [article]. _Carter, Nic._ CoinDesk. Retrieved 2023-03-22 from: <https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/22/the-reality-behind-the-crypto-banking-crackdown-operation-choke-point-20-is-here>.

  > **BRIEF**: Documents systematic de-banking of cryptocurrency companies through coordinated regulatory pressure on financial institutions—warning pattern for SSI.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Nic Carter documents the systematic de-banking of cryptocurrency companies through coordinated regulatory pressure on financial institutions. Federal regulators pressured banks to "pause" crypto-related activities, leading to widespread denial of banking services to legal businesses. The pattern mirrors the original Operation Choke Point targeting legal industries through intermediary pressure. Evidence later confirmed through FDIC letters obtained via FOIA requests, with Paul Grewal (Coinbase CLO) characterizing it as "not just some crypto conspiracy theory."

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: Documents the de-platforming pattern—regulators pressure intermediaries → intermediaries over-comply → legal users excluded without recourse. Warning for SSI: wallet providers could exclude "risky" users (activists, journalists, politically disfavored) through similar mechanisms.

### UDHR (1948)

* _**Universal Declaration of Human Rights**_ (1948). [treaty]. _United Nations General Assembly._ Resolution 217 A (III), adopted December 10, 1948, Paris. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights>. PDF: <https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf>.

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational international human rights framework establishing dignity as rights foundation—Article 20 grounds digital identity participation rights.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: The UDHR, adopted by UN General Assembly in 1948, establishes that all human beings are "born free and equal in dignity and rights" (Article 1). Its 30 articles enumerate fundamental rights including life, liberty, security, equality before law, privacy, freedom of thought and expression, and economic participation. Dignity precedes rights as the foundation—humans possess rights precisely because each has intrinsic worth. Translated into 562+ languages; inspired 70+ human rights treaties.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: Article 20 (freedom of peaceful assembly and association) grounds digital identity participation rights internationally. Forming credential networks, issuing community attestations, and participating in peer verification are protected assembly/association activities—not privileges platforms or governments may revoke at will.

### Citizens United (2010)

* _**Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission**_, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). [case]. _Supreme Court of the United States._ Decided January 21, 2010. Opinion by Justice Kennedy. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/>. Cornell: <https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html>.

  > **TAGS**: #FirstAmendment #FreedomOfAssociation #SupremeCourt #ConstitutionalLaw #CitizensUnited #PoliticalSpeech #OrganizationalRights

  > **BRIEF**: Establishes that freedom of association protects forming organizations and participating in collective activities without government permission.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: In Citizens United, the Supreme Court struck down BCRA provisions banning corporate independent expenditures as unconstitutional restrictions on political speech. Justice Kennedy's majority held that First Amendment protections don't diminish when speakers organize as corporations, and government cannot discriminate among speaker classes. The ruling overturned Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, enabling unlimited corporate and union election spending and paving the way for super PACs.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: Establishes that freedom of association protects forming organizations and participating in collective activities without government permission. For SSI: forming chamas, mutual aid networks, and grassroots credentialing organizations are protected activities. Government cannot mandate centralized ID that eliminates peer alternatives without implicating association rights.

### Renieris (2022) Freedom to Transact Critique

* _**Crypto's "Freedom to Transact" May Actually Threaten Human Rights**_ (2022). [article]. _Renieris, Elizabeth M._ Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), March 15, 2022. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.cigionline.org/articles/cryptos-freedom-to-transact-may-actually-threaten-human-rights/>.

  > **TAGS**: #FreedomToTransact #HumanRights #Crypto #Regulation #RenierisElizabeth #TransactionalAbsolutism #CollectiveInterests #CriticalAnalysis

  > **BRIEF**: Essential counterpoint—challenges absolute "right to transact" claims, distinguishing proportionate regulation from exclusionary gatekeeping.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Renieris challenges crypto advocates' claims that "freedom to transact" is a fundamental right. Writing after the Canadian truckers' protest and Russia sanctions debates, she notes this freedom appears in no binding human rights treaty or national constitution. She argues crypto-libertarian "transactional absolutism" prioritizing negative freedom over collective interests mirrors distorted free speech absolutism, undermining society's ability to respond to crises and thereby endangering all other rights.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: Essential counterpoint—this lens does NOT claim an absolute "right to transact" that precludes all oversight. Renieris's critique distinguishes proportionate regulation from exclusionary gatekeeping, reinforcing this lens's focus: preventing transactional controls from being weaponized to restrict participation, not precluding all regulation.

### Allen (2025) Right to Transact *(draft)*

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: The Case for an International Right to Freedom to Transact**_ (2025). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/RightToTransact/>.

  > **TAGS**: #RightToTransact #FreedomToTransact #HumanRights #EconomicAgency #AllenChristopher #DigitalIdentity #FinancialInclusion #ConstitutionalRights

  > **BRIEF**: Foundational argument that transactional freedom is prerequisite for exercising other rights—de-platforming undermines constitutional protections.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen argues that freedom to transact is conspicuously absent from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights yet essential for other rights to function. Economic agency enables people to exercise freedoms of expression, assembly, movement, and property ownership. Without transactional access, marginalized communities cannot fully participate in society or the global economy, rendering other constitutional liberties hollow.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: Foundational argument for this lens—transactional freedom isn't merely economic convenience but prerequisite for exercising other rights. Allen demonstrates that de-platforming from financial infrastructure (Operation Choke Point patterns) undermines constitutional protections that assume economic participation. SSI must ensure identity infrastructure doesn't become chokepoint for transactional exclusion.

### Khan & Vaheesan (2017) Market Power *(draft)*

* _**Market Power and Inequality: The Antitrust Counterrevolution and its Discontents**_ (2017). [paper]. _Khan, Lina; Vaheesan, Sandeep._ Harvard Law & Policy Review, Vol. 11, pp. 235-294. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/2790/>.

  > **TAGS**: #Antitrust #MarketPower #Monopoly #Inequality #KhanLina #VaheesanSandeep #PlatformEconomics #ConsumerProtection #CompetitionLaw

  > **BRIEF**: Analyzes how market power concentration enables gatekeeping and exclusion—applies directly to SSI infrastructure where monopoly positions create participation barriers.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Khan and Vaheesan argue that the 1980s reorientation of antitrust law—focusing exclusively on efficiency while ignoring wealth distribution and market access—contributed to rising inequality. Monopoly and oligopoly pricing transfers wealth from ordinary consumers to shareholders and executives. The paper examines consolidation in telecommunications (data caps, doubled prices vs. Europe) and healthcare (higher premiums from hospital mergers), advocating for reinvigorated antitrust enforcement.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Right to Transact Lens)_: When wallet providers or credential verifiers achieve monopoly/oligopoly positions, they can extract rents and exclude users without competitive pressure. Khan & Vaheesan's analysis of market power concentration applies directly to SSI infrastructure—identity "utilities" without competition become gatekeepers enabling the exclusion patterns this lens addresses.
