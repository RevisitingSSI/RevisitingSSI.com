## Who Should Participate?

This initiative needs diverse perspectives working together. We explicitly seek participants from different disciplines, backgrounds, and roles:

- **Academic & Research Participants**: All outputs are designed as citable scholarly contributions
- **Developer & Builder Participants**: Your implementation experience grounds principles in reality
- **Policy, Regulatory & Legal Participants**: Essential perspectives on feasibility and institutional adoption
- **Advocacy, Community & Lived-Experience Participants**: Irreplaceable knowledge about how identity systems function in practice
- **Early-Career Researchers & Students**: Fresh perspectives that often bridge gaps between communities

## Participation Expectations

These workshops are structured around Working Circles: collaborative groups doing real intellectual work together. Participants are expected to join a Working Circle, engage in collaborative writing, and participate in dialogue at meetings.

**Time Commitment:**

Active participation in Phase 1 will require
- Attendance at initial meetings, then two to three 90-minute Working Circle break-outs, during which the Lens Exploration Brief for your Working Circle will be created.

This is a working commitment, not an observation commitment. Those who wish to follow without active contribution are welcome to join the announcement list and read outputs as they're released. Workshop meetings are working sessions for active contributors.

Phase 2 will require a greater time commitment for anyone interested in writing full papers based on our topics. We encourage this; we would like as much collaborative work as possible, to create new ideasl for self-sovereign identity that reflect a good cross-section of our community. But it is not a requirement: your active participation in Phase 1 only would represent a well-appreciated contribution of ideas and content!
