  > **BRIEF**: Contrasts Western individualist "I think therefore I am" with Ubuntu's relational personhood: "I am because we are."

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Birhane contrasts Ubuntu philosophy ("a person is a person through other persons") with Cartesian individualism ("I think therefore I am") embedded throughout Western psychology. Memory research, bystander effect studies, and child development experiments treat subjects as decontextualized standalone entities, obscuring how context, relationships, and structural factors (gender, race) shape cognition and behavior. Bakhtin's dialogical philosophy and emerging embodied/enactive cognition approaches offer relational alternatives recognizing selfhood as co-constructed through social interaction.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Individualist assumptions hardcoded into SSI architecture exclude relational identity models dominant in non-Western cultures. If SSI systems treat identity as attribute container rather than something emerging from relationships, they cannot see or support the bonds through which people actually live—enabling harms like family separation and community credential marginalization.

  > **BRIEF**: Identifies five identity mental models (space-time, presentation, attribute, relationship, capability) and their intersections for SSI architecture.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Andrieu et al. identify five mental models causing identity discourse miscommunication: space-time (physical continuity), presentation (subject's self-determination—SSI foundation), attribute (data correlation—ISO/IEC 24760-1), relationship (Ubuntu "I am because we are"), capability (pragmatic ability—Bitcoin example). Paper analyzes intersections: presentation + relationship produces verifiable credentials architecture. Understanding all five enables better stakeholder collaboration and comprehensive system design.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: SSI community accepted relational identity as foundational model (presentation + relationship = verifiable credentials), yet implementations overwhelmingly built for presentation alone. This gap between theory and practice leaves relationship-aware architecture unrealized—the technical substrate for community credentials, bilateral consent, and chama membership remains unbuilt.

  > **TAGS**: #GenerativeIdentity #SSI #Decentralization #DigitalIdentity #Philosophy #SheldrakePhilip #AKASHA #IdentityTheory #Emergence #Complexity

  > **BRIEF**: Proposes "generative identity" moving beyond self-sovereignty's individual focus to embrace emergent, relational, and contextual identity.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Sheldrake proposes generative identity as alternative to self-sovereign identity, arguing SSI's foundational principles encode logical contradictions undermining its liberatory goals. Drawing on systems thinking, structuration theory, and Bateson's ecology of mind, he contends identity emerges through social co-creation rather than individual possession. Introduces five principles—change, co-constitution, omni-directionality, friction, and non-universality—accommodating identity's dynamic relational nature. Warns well-intentioned SSI implementations risk recreating surveillance infrastructures through emergent behaviors, as portable reputation systems naturally evolve into social credit mechanisms.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Co-constitution principle grounds bilateral consent: statement "X is friends with Y" cannot be owned by either party because it constitutes both identities simultaneously. Also warns that portable reputation systems naturally evolve toward social credit mechanisms—reinforcing this lens's concern about relationship-graph surveillance even in privacy-respecting SSI designs.

  > **BRIEF**: Argues identity emerges from community, not state capture; validates through Kenyan chamas (200,000+ groups, $1.7B, 42% GDP).

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Grigg argues that identity is an outcome of community, not captured state. Through rigorous analysis of identity theory, trust mechanics, Dunbar's number, and real-world validation via Kenyan chamas (savings groups), he demonstrates that peer-based identity in small trusted groups (10-30 people) with mutual financial stakes is the only model that hasn't failed. Provides devastating critique of state IDs, corporate data, PKI, and Web of Trust, then proposes group-forming networks with skin in the game as foundation for digital identity systems.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Essential evidence that community credentials work at scale—200,000+ Kenyan chamas controlling $1.7B (42% of Kenya's GDP) validate community-based trustworthiness assessment without institutional gatekeeping. For SSI: chama membership proving financial trustworthiness is more relevant than government ID for many contexts, but current architectures provide no infrastructure for community issuance.

### Allen (2024) Edge Identifiers

  > **TAGS**: #EdgeIdentifiers #Cliques #Cryptography #MuSig2 #FROST #SchnorrSignatures #RelationalIdentity #SSI #AllenChristopher #MultiPartyComputation

  > **BRIEF**: Proposes relationship-based cryptographic identity using edge identifiers and cliques with Schnorr multisig protocols.

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen challenges single-signature cryptographic identity, proposing relationship-based alternatives using Schnorr aggregatable multisig (MuSig2, FROST). He introduces edge identifiers (pairwise relationship keys) and cryptographic cliques (fully connected group keys) where identity emerges from relationships rather than individual keys. This "Relationship Signature Paradigm" distributes keys as cryptographic "fog" eliminating single points of failure, enables joint decision-making through unanimous consent, and models how identity actually forms through social connections. Addresses security vulnerabilities while returning SSI to its original relational vision.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Demonstrates relationship-aware SSI is technically feasible, not merely theoretical. Edge identifiers provide cryptographic substrate for bilateral consent (both parties must participate to create or use relationship key) and unilateral exit (either party can refuse to sign, dissolving the relationship credential). Cliques enable group identity for chamas and communities where the group key requires unanimous consent.
