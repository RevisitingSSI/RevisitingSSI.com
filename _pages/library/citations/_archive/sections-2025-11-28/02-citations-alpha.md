### Allen (2016) Path to Self-Sovereign Identity

* _**The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2016). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity [blog], April 26, 2016, updated 2020. Retrieved 2025-11-12 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/>. Cross-posted to CoinDesk, April 27, 2016.

  > **TAGS**: #SSI #Identity #SelfSovereignIdentity #Decentralization #DigitalIdentity #Privacy #UserControl #AllenChristopher #IdentityPrinciples #Web3 #TenPrinciples

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen establishes self-sovereign identity framework through historical analysis showing centralized, federated, and user-centric identity systems failed to give individuals true control. Proposes ten principles (Existence, Control, Access, Transparency, Persistence, Portability, Interoperability, Consent, Minimalization, Protection) as criteria for genuinely sovereign systems. Grounds identity in Descartes' *cogito ergo sum* and cryptographic precedents like PGP's Web of Trust, establishing SSI as technical infrastructure and human rights framework.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: Principle 1 (Existence): "Users must have an independent existence"—the ineffable "I" that precedes and transcends digital representations. This lens examines what happens when protective constraints like Principle 1 are operationalized against their original purpose.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: The original 10 SSI principles—analyze what paradigm assumptions they embedded. Understanding what was assumed in 2016 reveals what we might unknowingly assume in 2026.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Foundational 10 SSI principles that operationalization frameworks build upon. Essential for understanding original intent vs. subsequent interpretations. "Users must have an independent existence" meant identity precedes systems—contrast with CSSPS IP1's reversal demonstrates operationalization risk.

### Allen (2021) Principal Authority

* _**Principal Authority: A New Perspective on Self-Sovereign Identity**_ (2021). [article]. _Allen, Christopher (with Shannon Appelcline)._ Life With Alacrity [blog], September 15, 2021. Retrieved 2025-11-20 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/principal-authority/>.

  > **TAGS**: #SSI #AgencyLaw #PrincipalAuthority #Wyoming #SF0039 #LegalFramework #Delegation #FiduciaryDuty #AllenChristopher #DigitalIdentity

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen analyzes Wyoming's SF0039—first U.S. legal definition of digital identity using "principal authority" to import Agency law precedent. Reframes 10 SSI principles as rights (existence, control, persistence, consent), identity duties (access, transparency, portability, interoperability, minimization, protection), and Agency duties (specificity, responsibility, representation, fidelity, disclosure). Grounds SSI in peer-to-peer relationships mediated by state rather than property law's state sovereignty.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: Wyoming SF0039 provides first U.S. legal definition grounding digital identity in Agency law—importing centuries of common law precedent rather than requiring novel legislation. When individuals delegate to identity agents, agents owe enforceable duties with established remedies. Reorganizes SSI principles into Principal rights and Agent duties with legal teeth.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Choice Architecture Lens)_: Provides agency law framework where delegation with accountability enables genuine exit rights.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Provides legal framework (agency law) for operationalizing SSI through enforceable duties rather than technical properties alone. Multiple operationalization methodologies needed—technical properties (CSSPS), legal duties (Principal Authority), harm-based assessment, user-centric metrics address different dimensions.

### Allen (2024) Edge Identifiers

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: Edge Identifiers & Cliques**_ (2024). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity [blog], October 8, 2024. Retrieved 2025-11-20 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/cliques-1/>.

  > **TAGS**: #EdgeIdentifiers #Cliques #Cryptography #MuSig2 #FROST #SchnorrSignatures #RelationalIdentity #SSI #AllenChristopher #MultiPartyComputation

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen challenges single-signature cryptographic identity, proposing relationship-based alternatives using Schnorr aggregatable multisig (MuSig2, FROST). He introduces edge identifiers (pairwise relationship keys) and cryptographic cliques (fully connected group keys) where identity emerges from relationships rather than individual keys. This "Relationship Signature Paradigm" distributes keys as cryptographic "fog" eliminating single points of failure, enables joint decision-making through unanimous consent, and models how identity actually forms through social connections. Addresses security vulnerabilities while returning SSI to its original relational vision.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Demonstrates relationship-aware SSI is technically feasible, not merely theoretical. Edge identifiers provide cryptographic substrate for bilateral consent (both parties must participate to create or use relationship key) and unilateral exit (either party can refuse to sign, dissolving the relationship credential). Cliques enable group identity for chamas and communities where the group key requires unanimous consent.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Context Boundaries Lens)_: Edge identifiers enable context-specific relationship credentials that don't reveal other contexts. Different edge keys for work relationships vs. family relationships prevent correlation. Provides cryptographic substrate for protecting relationship privacy while enabling relationship credentials—critical for context boundaries.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Demonstrates how paradigm shifts happen—not as incremental improvement but as reconceptualization. The "Relationship Signature Paradigm" shows what becomes possible when we question the assumption that identity must be individual.

### Allen (2025) Digital Law Framework

* _**Digital Law Framework: A Trust Architect's Contribution to State Digital Policy**_ (2025). [paper]. _Allen, Christopher._ Community Draft for Comments, September 3, 2025. Supplement to "The Architecture of Autonomy". Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2BKTvJMtR_7W34Np2yCAvRJKC_kb-Cw3XsSgCes6bg/edit>.

  > **TAGS**: #DigitalLawFramework #ModelLegislation #AntiCoercion #CryptographicSecrets #DigitalSignatures #AllenChristopher #LegalArchitecture #StatePolicy #VerifiableRecords

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Allen proposes model legislation for state digital policy structured in four layers: Layer 0 (Cryptographic Secret Protection—preventing forced key disclosure), Layer 1 (Digital Signature and Assent), Layer 2 (Cryptographically Verifiable Records as self-authenticating evidence), and Layer 3 (Digital Identity Recognition via verifiable credentials). The framework translates technical distinctions into legal categories, includes anti-coercion provisions and portability requirements, and can be adopted incrementally at no cost.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: Four-layer model legislation demonstrating technology-neutral regulatory approach. Includes anti-coercion provisions (economic duress protection, essential service obligations, behavioral surplus extraction prohibitions), platform independence requirements, and standards framework. Foundation for regulatory frameworks supporting SSI without creating centralization.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principles to Compliance Lens)_: Technology-neutral legal framework showing how existing law (agency, evidence, contracts) applies to cryptographic systems. Four coordinated acts establish Tier 2 regulatory requirements: cryptographic secret protection, digital signature validity, self-authentication of verifiable records, credential recognition. Critical anti-coercion provisions address platform abuses.

### Allen (2025) Exodus Protocol

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: The Exodus Protocol**_ (2025). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity, October 28, 2025. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/musings-exodus.protocol>.

  > **TAGS**: #ExodusProtocol #Enshittification #AutonomousSystems #MathematicsOverPolicy #AllenChristopher #Decentralization #DigitalInfrastructure #Portability

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Christopher Allen addresses how centralized digital services repeatedly fail users through "enshittification"—documenting personal experience losing educational infrastructure when Yahoo acquired del.icio.us and Google shut down Reader. Proposes Exodus Protocols as systems operating without external dependencies through five design patterns: operate without centralized infrastructure, encode rules mathematically rather than through policy, make constraints load-bearing, preserve exit through portability via open standards, and work offline across time. Cites Bitcoin as exemplar. Technologies like Gordian Clubs, animated QR codes, and threshold signatures serve as building blocks for autonomous coordination, collaboration, and identity systems.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Cryptographic Paradigms Lens)_: Establishes "infrastructure without infrastructure"—systems functioning autonomously without centralized control. "Mathematics over policy": fundamental capabilities as mathematical rights, not permissions granted by companies. Demonstrates paradigm-level thinking about what SSI architecture should enable.

### Allen (2025) Swiss e-ID Anchors

* _**Musings of a Trust Architect: Five Anchors to Preserve Autonomy & Sovereignty**_ (2025). [article]. _Allen, Christopher._ Life With Alacrity. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/musings-swiss-eid/>.

  > **TAGS**: #SwissEID #DigitalIdentity #Autonomy #Sovereignty #PlatformIndependence #InstitutionalSafeguards #AllenChristopher #GovernmentID #PrivacyByDesign

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Christopher Allen examines Switzerland's e-ID adoption and proposes five anchors protecting personal autonomy and democratic sovereignty: (1) Preserve Choice by Design—voluntary participation with granular data sharing control; (2) Build Long-Term Architecture—20-year sustainability with data minimization; (3) Maintain Platform Independence—prevent Apple/Google surveillance through jurisdictional oversight; (4) Require Duties for Commercial Parties—strict purpose limitation and deletion requirements; (5) Implement Institutional Safeguards—independent governance protecting against government overreach and corporate misuse. Demonstrates how government identity systems can preserve autonomy: "agency over our digital identity remains with us."

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Regulatory Framework Lens)_: Demonstrates how government digital identity systems can preserve autonomy. Addresses documented pattern where "voluntary in law" erodes to "mandatory in practice" (Estonia 99% adoption, India Aadhaar, Ireland Public Services Card).

### Andrieu et al. (2020) Five Mental Models

* _**Five Mental Models of Identity**_ (2020). [white paper]. _Andrieu, Joe; George, Nathan; Hughes, Andrew; MacIntosh, Christophe; Rondelet, Antoine._ Rebooting the Web of Trust VII. Published 2020-03-19. Retrieved 2025-11-18 from: <https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.pdf>.

  > **TAGS**: #Identity #MentalModels #SSI #WebOfTrust #RWOT #VerifiableCredentials #IdentityTheory #AndrieuJoe #DigitalIdentity #Framework

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Andrieu et al. identify five mental models causing identity discourse miscommunication: space-time (physical continuity), presentation (subject's self-determination—SSI foundation), attribute (data correlation—ISO/IEC 24760-1), relationship (Ubuntu "I am because we are"), capability (pragmatic ability—Bitcoin example). Paper analyzes intersections: presentation + relationship produces verifiable credentials architecture. Understanding all five enables better stakeholder collaboration and comprehensive system design.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: SSI community accepted relational identity as foundational model (presentation + relationship = verifiable credentials), yet implementations overwhelmingly built for presentation alone. This gap between theory and practice leaves relationship-aware architecture unrealized—the technical substrate for community credentials, bilateral consent, and chama membership remains unbuilt.

### Baird et al. (2023) Threshold Signatures

* _**Threshold Signatures in the Multiverse**_ (2023). [cryptography paper]. _Baird, Leemon; Garg, Sanjam; Jain, Abhishek; Mukherjee, Pratyay; Sinha, Rohit; Wang, Mingyuan; Zhang, Yinuo._ Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2023/063. Available from: <https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/063>.

  > **TAGS**: #ThresholdSignatures #DistributedAuthority #MultiPartyComputation #CryptographicSecurity #KofNSignatures #Guardianship #KeyRecovery #AbusePreventions

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Baird et al. examine threshold signature schemes where K-of-N parties must cooperate to create valid signatures, enabling distributed authority without single points of control. Key properties: no single party can sign unilaterally (prevents abuse), losing up to N-K parties doesn't prevent signing (resilience), signature appears identical to single-party signature (privacy), threshold can adjust over time (graduated authority). SSI applications: guardianship requiring parent + child + trusted third party for sensitive operations (prevents guardian abuse while supporting incapacity), custodianship using 2-of-3 recovery (user + platform + social recovery, no single point of failure), role separation for credential issuance (employer + employee both must sign, prevents forgery). Provides cryptographic foundation for implementing graduated obligations from Principal Authority lens and preventing abuse vectors identified in guardianship contexts.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Technical Delegation Lens)_: Modern threshold signature schemes enabling distributed authority where K-of-N parties must cooperate—cryptographic foundation for preventing single points of failure and abuse in guardianship, custodianship, and role separation.

### Balkin (2016) Information Fiduciaries

* _**Information Fiduciaries and the First Amendment**_ (2016). [paper]. _Balkin, Jack M._ UC Davis Law Review, Vol. 49, No. 4, pp. 1183-1234. Yale Law School, Public Law Research Paper No. 553. Retrieved 2025-11-27 from: <https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/isp/documents/930am_49-4_balkin.pdf>. Also available at SSRN: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2675270>.

  > **TAGS**: #InformationFiduciaries #FirstAmendment #DigitalPrivacy #FiduciaryDuty #PlatformGovernance #BalkinJack #LegalTheory #DataProtection #ConstitutionalLaw

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Balkin introduces the "information fiduciary" concept to explain how digital privacy can be protected consistent with the First Amendment. Like doctors and lawyers, online service providers who encourage trust should assume special duties regarding information obtained from users. Governments may impose privacy regulations enforcing these fiduciary obligations without violating free speech protections. The framework also explains why the third-party doctrine should be modified in Fourth Amendment law.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Principal Authority Lens)_: Extends fiduciary law to digital relationships—platforms holding user data in positions of trust owe duties of care, confidentiality, and loyalty. Proposes graduated duties matching delegation depth, supporting this lens's framework of fiduciaries (highest duties), agents (moderate duties), and bailees (minimal duties).

### Benjamin (2019) Race After Technology

* _**Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code**_ (2019). [book]. _Benjamin, Ruha._ Polity Press. ISBN: 978-1509526406. Available from author: <https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology>. Publisher: <https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Race+After+Technology:+Abolitionist+Tools+for+the+New+Jim+Code-p-9781509526437>.

  > **TAGS**: #AlgorithmicBias #RacialJustice #Technology #Discrimination #NewJimCode #Surveillance #ArtificialIntelligence #SocialJustice #BenjaminRuha #CriticalRaceStudies #TechEthics

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Benjamin introduces the "New Jim Code"—new technologies that reflect and reproduce existing inequities while promoted as objective and progressive. Through examples ranging from gang databases 87% Black and Latinx to beauty contests judged by robots selecting only white winners, she demonstrates how automation hides, speeds, and deepens discrimination while appearing neutral. Because technology is human-created and learns from biased data, none is free from human prejudice.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: "Being excluded from the registry is tantamount to being denied existence." Documents how systems treating measurement as validation enable exclusion—colonial registries, Jim Crow tests, apartheid passes, contemporary algorithmic exclusion. Shows why dignity must precede encoding, not depend on it.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Coercion Resistance Lens)_: Shows how identity systems encode social hierarchies into technical architecture, creating structural coercion for marginalized communities. "Coded inequity" appears neutral while perpetuating injustice—technology embeds and amplifies racial discrimination.

### Birhane (2017) Ubuntu Philosophy

* _**Descartes was wrong: 'a person is a person through other persons'**_ (2017). [article]. _Birhane, Abeba._ Aeon Ideas [online magazine]. Published 2017-04-07. Retrieved 2025-11-19 from: <https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons>.

  > **TAGS**: #Ubuntu #AfricanPhilosophy #RelationalIdentity #Personhood #Descartes #WesternPhilosophy #CommunityIdentity #BirhaneAbeba #Interdependence #Philosophy

  > **SHORT ABSTRACT**: Birhane contrasts Ubuntu philosophy ("a person is a person through other persons") with Cartesian individualism ("I think therefore I am") embedded throughout Western psychology. Memory research, bystander effect studies, and child development experiments treat subjects as decontextualized standalone entities, obscuring how context, relationships, and structural factors (gender, race) shape cognition and behavior. Bakhtin's dialogical philosophy and emerging embodied/enactive cognition approaches offer relational alternatives recognizing selfhood as co-constructed through social interaction.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Irreducible Person Lens)_: Challenges assumption that identity is primarily individual property. If personhood is fundamentally relational ("I am because we are"), SSI systems must support relational identity, not just individual credentials. Expands "irreducible person" beyond Western individualism to include relational and community dimensions of existence.

  > **WHY THIS MATTERS** _(for Relational Autonomy Lens)_: Individualist assumptions hardcoded into SSI architecture exclude relational identity models dominant in non-Western cultures. If SSI systems treat identity as attribute container rather than something emerging from relationships, they cannot see or support the bonds through which people actually live—enabling harms like family separation and community credential marginalization.
