# Citations Library

This library consolidates all citations referenced across the Revisiting Self-Sovereign Identity lens briefs. It is organized in two sections:

1. **[Lenses](#lenses)**: Browse citations by lens, with each lens providing context and linking to its supporting citations
2. **[Citations](#citations-full-reference)**: Full alphabetical reference with aggregated "Why This Matters" sections showing cross-lens relevance

Each citation appears once in the reference section with all its lens-specific relevance aggregated together, making it easy to see how sources inform multiple perspectives.
