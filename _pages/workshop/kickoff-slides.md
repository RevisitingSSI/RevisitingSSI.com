# Part 1

## The Ten-Year Question

---

<!-- .slide: id="year-2016" -->

## April 2016

I published ten principles for self-sovereign identity.

They were aspirational—a compass, not a map.

---

<!-- .slide: id="movement" -->

## The Movement (2016–2021)

The principles caught fire.

- Hundreds of articles and academic papers
- Broad acceptance across technologists, policymakers, advocates
- W3C working groups, government pilots, enterprise interest

A global community formed around decentralized digital identity

**The principles inspired people.**

---

<!-- .slide: id="success" -->

## Technical Success…

- DIDs: W3C Recommendation ✓
- Verifiable Credentials: Standard ✓
- Government pilots: Dozens ✓

The architecture worked. The standards shipped.

But somewhere along the way…

### _The principles got lost_.

---

<!-- .slide: id="crisis" -->

## What Went Wrong

- Focused on _**privacy**_ instead of what privacy defends: _**resisting coercion**_
- Followed the money. Death by 1000 compromises
- `did:web`—“decentralized” in name only
- Google & Apple—more resources, centralized solutions—are winning
- Governments focused on “Four Horsemen”<br/>_(terror, pedophilia, drugs, money)_ while the real threat is **autocracy**

---

<!-- .slide: id="crisis-2" -->

## The Result

* We hoped to _**reduce**_ centralized power

* But we became indistinguishable from the very systems we set out to disrupt

> "If we can't maintain semantic integrity of 'decentralized' in our own community, how can we fight for it in the larger world?"

We may have _**increased**_ centralized power

---

<!-- .slide: id="question" -->

## The Question

* _What did we get right?_

* _What did we miss?_

* _What must change for the next decade?_

---

<!-- .slide: id="why-you" -->

## Why You're Here

We need diverse expertise:

- Technologists + Lawyers
- Advocates + Academics
- Policy experts + Lived experience

_**We are not building specs—<br/>we are doing a strategic inquiry**_

---

<!-- .slide: id="introductions" -->

## Quick Introductions

Raise your Zoom hand to share:

1. **Name** & **affiliation** *(if any)*
2. **One sentence**: What brings you to this work?

*~30 seconds each • I'll go first to model*

Note: speaker-notes
**Model intro (~20 sec):**
"I'm Christopher Allen. I wrote the original ten principles in 2016. I'm here because I believe we lost our way—and this community can help us find it again."

**If someone runs long:**
"Thank you—great context! Who's next?"

**After 10-12 intros:**
"We won't get to everyone now, but you'll introduce yourselves in your working circles. Let's continue."
Note: end-speaker-notes

<!-- .slide: id="outputs" -->

## What We'll Produce

| Phase | Output | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Lens Briefs | Dec–Jan |
| 2 | Full Papers | Feb–Apr |
| 3 | Revised Principles<br/>_**Exactly ten years<br/>after the original.**_ | April 28, 2026 |
| 4 | Papers and articles based<br/>on the Revised Principles| May-Dec |

# Part 2

## The 15 Lenses

---

<!-- .slide: id="what-lenses" -->

## What Are Lenses?

Each lens reveals something the others miss.

No single lens is complete.

Each working circle goes _**deep on one**_<br/>while staying aware of the whole.

---

<!-- .slide: id="four-categories" -->

## Four Categories

1. **Foundational Principles & Rights** (4)
2. **Preventing Coercion** (4)
3. **Relational & Contextual Identity** (4)
4. **Compliance, Governance & Technical** (3)

---

<!-- .slide: id="category1" -->

## Category 1: Foundational Principles & Rights

What makes identity a _**right**_</br>rather than a privilege?

<font size=6>
    
- **Irreducible Person** — Existence before encoding
- **Anti-Property** — Identity cannot be owned or sold
- **Right to Transact** — Digital participation as constitutional right
- **Cryptographic Paradigms** — Assumptions that shape possibility

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="irreducible-person" -->

## 1. Irreducible Person

### Core insight:
Existence isn't earned or proven—it simply *is*.

### Key question:
How do we protect dignity from being made measurable?

*Example: Aadhaar biometric exclusion—existence conditioned on encoding.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="anti-property" -->

## 2. Anti-Property

### Core insight:
Identity cannot be owned, bought, sold, or treated as property.

### Key question:
How do we resist "data ownership" commodification?

*"Owning your data" legitimizes markets that shouldn't exist.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="right-to-transact" -->

## 3. Right to Transact

### Core insight:
Digital participation is a constitutional right.

### Key question:
How do we prevent exclusion by gatekeepers?

*Operation Choke Point 2.0: Banks weaponized as censors.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="crypto-paradigms" -->

## 4. Cryptographic Paradigms

### Core insight:
PKI assumptions constrained us for 36 years.

### Key question:
What assumptions are we embedding now that will limit 2036?

*What can't we invent because current paradigms block it?*

---

<!-- .slide: id="category2" -->

## Category 2: Preventing Coercion

How do systems compel behavior—</br>and how do we resist?

<font size=6>
    
- **Coercion Resistance** — Privacy defends against force
- **Self-Coercion** — When control feels like your own idea
- **Choice Architecture** — Small choices become structural traps
- **Binding Commitments** — When constraint enables trust

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="coercion-resistance" -->

## 5. Coercion Resistance

### Core insight:
Privacy is the shield. Coercion resistance is the goal.

### Four dimensions:
- Interface (dark patterns)
- Inference (profiling)
- Structural (lock-in)
- Psychological (self-censorship)

----

<!-- .slide: id="self-coercion" -->

## 6. Self-Coercion

### Core insight:
The most effective control feels like your own idea.

### Key question:
How do we counter chilling effects?

*You modify behavior based on imagined consequences—no rule needed.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="choice-architecture" -->

## 7. Choice Architecture

### Core insight:
Small voluntary choices accumulate into structural dependency.

### Key question:
How do we ensure real exit rights?

*"The 18-year trap": Credentials that won't transfer.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="binding-commitments" -->

## 8. Binding Commitments

### Core insight:
Not all lock-in is harmful. Voluntary constraint enables trust.

### Key question:
When is commitment productive vs. exploitative?

*Kenyan chamas: 200,000+ groups managing $1.7B through mutual stakes.*

---

<!-- .slide: id="category3" -->

## Category 3: Relational & Contextual Identity

Identity exists in relationship—<br/>to others, to context, to scale.

<font size=6>
    
- **Relational Autonomy** — "I am because we are"
- **Context Boundaries** — Keeping life spheres distinct
- **Multi-Scalar Sovereignty** — Individual, community, nation
- **Stewardship** — Caring for those who cannot consent

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="relational-autonomy" -->

## 9. Relational Autonomy

### Core insight:
"I am because we are." —Ubuntu philosophy

### Key question:
How do we credential relationships, not just attributes?

*Immigration systems separate families—bonds are invisible.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="context-boundaries" -->

## 10. Context Boundaries

### Core insight:
Your employer shouldn't see therapy notes.

### Key question:
How do we prevent correlation attacks?

*Unlinkable identifiers keep life spheres cryptographically distinct.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="multi-scalar" -->

## 11. Multi-Scalar Sovereignty

### Core insight:
Sovereignty operates at individual, community, AND national scales.

### Key question:
How do we prevent re-centralization?

*Technical distribution ≠ political distribution.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="stewardship" -->

## 12. Stewardship

### Core insight:
When caring for others' identity—empowering or exploiting?

### Key question:
How do we protect those who can't exit or refuse?

*18 years of credential accumulation without child consent.*

---

<!-- .slide: id="category4" -->

## Category 4: Compliance, Governance & Technical

How do our principles survive contact<br/>with law, standards, and power?

<font size=6>
    
- **Principles to Compliance** — Not everything can be measured
- **Regulatory Frameworks** — Voluntary erodes to mandatory
- **Principal Authority** — Restoring accountability to agents

</font>

----

<!-- .slide: id="principles-compliance" -->

## 13. Principles to Compliance

### Core insight:
Not everything important can be measured.

### Key question:
What must remain ethical commitment vs. technical test?

*Treating all principles as measurable destroys the ones that matter most.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="regulatory" -->

## 14. Regulatory Frameworks

### Core insight:
Legal "voluntary" erodes to practical "mandatory."

### Key question:
How do we enable SSI without mandating it?

*Utah model: Recognition without government monopoly.*

----

<!-- .slide: id="principal-authority" -->

## 15. Principal Authority

### Core insight:
Platforms violate every duty agents owe principals.

### Key question:
How do we restore accountability?

*Centuries of agency law—enforceable duties of care, loyalty, disclosure.*

---

<!-- .slide: id="connections" -->

## Lens Connections

These aren't silos.

- Stewardship ↔ Relational Autonomy
- Coercion Resistance threads through everything
- Context Boundaries ↔ Multi-Scalar Sovereignty

Each brief acknowledges connections while going deep on one.

---

<!-- .slide: id="briefs-status" -->

## These Are Starting Points

The lens briefs are early drafts—provocations, not conclusions.

- New lenses may emerge from your work
- We won't tackle all equally—and that's okay
- Coverage will be organic, based on interest and expertise

Your working circle takes ownership of where one lens goes next.
